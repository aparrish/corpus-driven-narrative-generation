A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	53	The play opens with Hermia, who is in love with Lysander, resistant to her father Egeus' demand that she wed Demetrius, whom he has arranged for her to marry.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	2	53	Helena meanwhile pines unrequitedly for Demetrius.

A Midsummer Night's Dream	5	53	Peter Quince and his fellow players Nick Bottom, Francis Flute, Robin Starveling, Tom Snout, and Snug plan to put on a play for the wedding of the Duke and the Queen, "the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe".

A Midsummer Night's Dream	10	53	Quince ends the meeting with "at the Duke's oak we meet".
A Midsummer Night's Dream	11	53	In a parallel plot line, Oberon, king of the fairies, and Titania, his queen, have come to the forest outside Athens.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	12	53	Titania tells Oberon that she plans to stay there until she has attended Theseus and Hippolyta's wedding.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	13	53	Oberon and Titania are estranged because Titania refuses to give her Indian changeling to Oberon for use as his "knight" or "henchman", since the child's mother was one of Titania's worshippers.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	14	53	Oberon seeks to punish Titania's disobedience.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	15	53	He calls upon Robin "Puck" Goodfellow, his "shrewd and knavish sprite", to help him concoct a magical juice derived from a flower called "love-in-idleness", which turns from white to purple when struck by Cupid's arrow.

A Midsummer Night's Dream	17	53	He instructs Puck to retrieve the flower with the hope that he might make Titania fall in love with an animal of the forest and thereby shame her into giving up the little Indian boy.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	18	53	He says, "And ere I take this charm from off her sight,/As I can take it with another herb,/I'll make her render up her page to me".
A Midsummer Night's Dream	19	53	Hermia and Lysander have escaped to the same forest in hopes of eloping.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	20	53	Helena, desperate to reclaim Demetrius's love, tells Demetrius about the plan and he follows them in hopes of killing Lysander.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	21	53	Helena continually makes advances towards Demetrius, promising to love him more than Hermia.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	22	53	However, he rebuffs her with cruel insults against her.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	23	53	Observing this, Oberon orders Puck to spread some of the magical juice from the flower on the eyelids of the young Athenian man.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	24	53	Instead, Puck mistakes Lysander for Demetrius, not having actually seen either before, and administers the juice to the sleeping Lysander.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	25	53	Helena, coming across him, wakes him while attempting to determine whether he is dead or asleep.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	26	53	Upon this happening, Lysander immediately falls in love with Helena.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	27	53	Oberon sees Demetrius still following Hermia and is enraged.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	28	53	When Demetrius goes to sleep, Oberon sends Puck to get Helena while he charms Demetrius' eyes.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	29	53	Upon waking up, he sees Helena.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	30	53	Now, both men are in pursuit of Helena.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	31	53	However, she is convinced that her two suitors are mocking her, as neither loved her originally.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	32	53	Hermia is at a loss to see why her lover has abandoned her, and accuses Helena of stealing Lysander away from her.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	33	53	The four quarrel with each other until Lysander and Demetrius become so enraged that they seek a place to duel to prove whose love for Helena is the greater.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	34	53	Oberon orders Puck to keep Lysander and Demetrius from catching up with one another and to remove the charm from Lysander so Lysander can return to love Hermia, while Demetrius continues to love Helena.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	35	53	Meanwhile, Quince and his band of six labourers ("rude mechanicals", as they are described by Puck) have arranged to perform their play about Pyramus and Thisbe for Theseus' wedding and venture into the forest, near Titania's bower, for their rehearsal.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	36	53	Bottom is spotted by Puck, who (taking his name to be another word for a jackass) transforms his head into that of a donkey.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	37	53	When Bottom returns for his next lines, the other workmen run screaming in terror: They claim that they are haunted, much to Bottom's confusion.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	38	53	Determined to await his friends, he begins to sing to himself.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	39	53	Titania, having received the love-potion, is awakened by Bottom's singing and immediately falls in love with him.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	40	53	She lavishes him with the attention of her and her fairies, and while she is in this state of devotion, Oberon takes the changeling.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	41	53	Having achieved his goals, Oberon releases Titania, orders Puck to remove the donkey's head from Bottom, and arranges everything so Helena, Hermia, Demetrius and Lysander will all believe they have been dreaming when they awaken.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	42	53	Puck distracts Lysander and Demetrius from fighting over Helena's love by mimicking their voices and leading them apart.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	43	53	Eventually, all four find themselves separately falling asleep in the glade.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	44	53	Once they fall asleep, Puck administers the love potion to Lysander again, claiming all will be well in the morning.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	45	53	The fairies then disappear, and Theseus and Hippolyta arrive on the scene, during an early morning hunt.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	46	53	They wake the lovers and, since Demetrius no longer loves Hermia, Theseus over-rules Egeus's demands and arranges a group wedding.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	47	53	The lovers decide that the night's events must have been a dream.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	48	53	After they exit, Bottom awakes, and he too decides that he must have experienced a dream "past the wit of man".
A Midsummer Night's Dream	49	53	In Athens, Theseus, Hippolyta and the lovers watch the six workmen perform Pyramus and Thisbe.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	50	53	The performers are so terrible playing their roles that the guests laugh as if it were meant to be a comedy, and everyone retires to bed.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	51	53	Afterwards, Oberon, Titania, Puck, and other fairies enter, and bless the house and its occupants with good fortune.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	52	53	After all the other characters leave, Puck "restores amends" and suggests to the audience that what they just experienced might be nothing more than a dream.

The Apartment	1	39	In order to climb the corporate ladder, Bud allows four company managers, who reinforce their position over him by regularly calling him "Buddy Boy," to take turns borrowing his Upper West Side apartment for their various extramarital liaisons, which are so noisy that his neighbors assume that he is a playboy bringing home different women every night.

The World According to Garp	0	24	The story deals with the life of Garp.

The World According to Garp	2	24	She encounters a dying ball turret gunner known only as Technical Sergeant Garp, who was severely brain damaged in combat.
The World According to Garp	3	24	Jenny nurses Garp, observing his infantile state and almost perpetual autonomic sexual arousal.
The World According to Garp	4	24	As a matter of practicality and kindness in making his passing as comfortable as possible and reducing his agitation, she manually gratifies him several times.
The World According to Garp	5	24	Unconstrained by convention and driven by practicality and her desire for a child, Jenny rapes Technical Sergeant Garp, and uses his semen to impregnate herself and names the resulting son "T".
The World According to Garp	6	24	(a name derived from "Technical Sergeant", but consisting of just initials).
The World According to Garp	7	24	Jenny raises young Garp alone, taking a position at the all-boys Steering School in New England.
The World According to Garp	8	24	Garp grows up, becoming interested in sex, wrestling, and writing fiction&mdash;three topics in which his mother has little interest.
The World According to Garp	9	24	After his graduation in 1961, his mother takes him to Vienna, where he writes his first novella.
The World According to Garp	10	24	At the same time, his mother begins writing her autobiography, A Sexual Suspect.
The World According to Garp	11	24	After Jenny and Garp return to Steering, Garp marries Helen, the wrestling coach's daughter, and begins his family—he a struggling writer, she a teacher of English.
The World According to Garp	12	24	The publication of A Sexual Suspect makes his mother famous.
The World According to Garp	13	24	She becomes a feminist icon, as feminists view her book as a manifesto of a woman who does not care to bind herself to a man, and who chooses to raise a child on her own.
The World According to Garp	14	24	She nurtures and supports women traumatized by men, among them the Ellen Jamesians, a group of women named after an eleven-year-old girl whose tongue was cut off by her rapists to silence her.
The World According to Garp	15	24	The members of the group cut off their own tongues in support of the girl.
The World According to Garp	16	24	Garp becomes a devoted parent, wrestling with anxiety for the safety of his children and a desire to keep them safe from the dangers of the world.
The World According to Garp	17	24	He and his family inevitably experience dark and violent events through which the characters change and grow.
The World According to Garp	18	24	Garp learns (often painfully) from the women in his life (including transsexual ex-football player Roberta Muldoon), who are struggling to become more tolerant in the face of intolerance.
The World According to Garp	19	24	The story contains a great deal of (in the words of Garp's fictional teacher) "lunacy and sorrow", and the sometimes ridiculous chains of events the characters experience still resonate with painful truth.
The World According to Garp	20	24	The novel contains several framed narratives: Garp's first novella, The Pension Grillparzer; "Vigilance", a short story; and the first chapter of his novel, The World According to Bensenhaver.
The World According to Garp	21	24	The book also contains some motifs that appear in almost all John Irving novels: bears, New England, Vienna, wrestling, people who are uninterested in having sex, and a complex Dickensian plot that spans the protagonist's whole life.
The World According to Garp	22	24	Adultery (another common Irving motif) also plays a large part, culminating in one of the novel's most harrowing and memorable scenes.
The World According to Garp	23	24	Another familiar Irving trope, castration anxiety, is present, most obviously in the fate of one character, Michael Milton.

Coming to America	0	22	Akeem Joffer, the heir to the throne of Zamunda (a fictional African kingdom), lives a pampered lifestyle with every daily task performed by servants.
Coming to America	1	22	Akeem has become fed up with this and wishes to do more for himself.
Coming to America	2	22	The final straw comes when his parents, King Jaffe and Queen Aeoleon, present him with an arranged bride-to-be named Imani Izzi, whom he has never met and who has been trained to obey Akeem's every command.
Coming to America	3	22	Akeem concocts a plan to travel to the United States to find an intelligent, independent-minded woman he can both love and respect, and who will love Akeem for who he is and not for his wealth and social status as a prince.

Coming to America	7	22	Akeem soon falls in love with Lisa, who possesses all the qualities that the prince is looking for in a woman, as first seen by Akeem at a rally where she makes a strong plea to renovate a playground.
Coming to America	8	22	The rest of the film centers on Akeem's attempts to win Lisa's hand in marriage, which is complicated by Lisa's lazy and obnoxious boyfriend, Darryl Jenks (Eriq La Salle), whose father owns "Soul Glo" (a Jheri curl–like hairstyling aid).

Coming to America	12	22	This causes Akeem's parents to travel to Queens and expose Akeem's identity as a prince to the McDowells.
Coming to America	13	22	mr McDowell, initially disapproving of the match as he did not want to see his daughter with a man of poor means, is ecstatic that she has in fact attracted the interest of an extremely wealthy prince, but Lisa becomes angry and confused as to why Akeem lied to her about his identity, as he had told her before that he was actually a Zamundan goat herder.
Coming to America	14	22	Still hurt and angry that Akeem lied to her, she refuses to marry him, even after he offers to renounce his throne, and he returns home with a broken heart, resigned to marry the woman chosen for him by his parents.
Coming to America	15	22	On the way to the airport, King Jaffe remarks that Akeem can't marry Lisa anyway because of "tradition," and tries defending himself by saying "Who am I to change it.

Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	0	47	In 1850, backwoodsman Adam Pontipee comes into a town in the Oregon Territory to search for a bride.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	1	47	Met with ridicule by some locals, he comes upon the local tavern where he meets Milly.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	2	47	Convinced of her worth by the quality of her cooking and her insistence on finishing her chores before she would leave with him, he proposes and she accepts despite knowing each other for only a few hours.

Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	4	47	When they arrive at his cabin in the mountains, Milly is surprised to learn that Adam is one of seven brothers living under the same roof.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	5	47	The brothers have been named alphabetically from the Old Testament in order of birth: Adam, Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel, Ephraim, Frank (short for frankincense, the Old Testament having no names beginning with F), and Gideon.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	6	47	All of the brothers have red hair and all but Gideon are well over six feet tall.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	7	47	Milly teaches Adam's rowdy, ill-behaved younger brothers manners and social mores.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	8	47	She also shows them how to dance.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	9	47	At first, the brothers have a hard time changing from their "mountain man" ways, but eventually each comes to see that the only way he will get a woman of his own is to do things Milly's way.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	10	47	They try out their new manners at a barn-raising, where they meet six women they like — Dorcas, Ruth, Martha, Liza, Sarah, and Alice.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	11	47	The girls take a fancy to the brothers as well.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	12	47	However, they already have suitors among the young men of the town, who jealously taunt the brothers into fighting during the barn-raising.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	13	47	At first the six brothers remember Milly's teaching and try to resist being drawn into a fight by accepting physical indignities.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	14	47	Adam refuses to let himself be pushed around by the rival suitors and calls his younger brothers cowards for letting them get away with their behavior.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	15	47	The girls' suitors from the town finally go too far when they attack Adam, provoking Gideon into fighting back.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	16	47	A free-for-all ensues in which the brothers dominate their physically weaker townie rivals.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	17	47	Although the Pontipees did not start the fight, they are banished from the town after demolishing the barn they were raising in the course of the brawl.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	18	47	Winter finds the six younger brothers pining for the girls for whom they had fallen fast and hard.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	19	47	Milly asks Adam to talk to the brothers as she fears they will want to leave because of missing the girls.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	20	47	Adam reads his brothers the story of "The Sobbin' Women" (taken from Plutarch's story of the Sabine Women), one of the books Milly brought to the homestead.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	21	47	He tells them that they should stop moping around and take whatever action is necessary to get their women.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	22	47	Aided by Adam, the brothers kidnap the six girls, then cause an avalanche in Echo Pass so that they cannot be followed by the townspeople.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	23	47	The only problem: they forgot to bring the parson to perform the marriages.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	24	47	Milly is furious with Adam, as are the six kidnapped women.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	25	47	Milly consigns the brothers to the barn "with the rest of the livestock" while the women live in the house.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	26	47	Adam, feeling betrayed by Milly's reaction, leaves for the trapping cabin farther up the mountain to live out the winter by himself, unknowingly hurting Milly's feelings.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	27	47	Soon after, Milly realizes that she is pregnant by Adam.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	28	47	The winter months slowly pass.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	29	47	The women vent their frustration and resentment by playing pranks on the brothers, such as hitting them with rock-filled snowballs and dumping basins of wash water on them.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	30	47	By spring, the women have forgiven their "kidnappers" and fallen in love with the brothers, who are now allowed to court them.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	31	47	Milly gives birth to a daughter, Hannah.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	32	47	Gideon rides to the cabin to inform Adam of his daughter's arrival and asks him to come home.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	33	47	Adam refuses, saying that he had said he would return home only when the snow had melted enough that the pass was open to traffic.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	34	47	Having time to think about his baby daughter, Adam returns home in the spring just as Echo Pass is opening and reconciles with Milly.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	35	47	As a newly responsible father, he has become aware of how worried the townspeople would be about what has happened to the six abducted girls.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	36	47	Adam realizes he was wrong to tell his brothers to kidnap them.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	37	47	He tells his brothers they need to take the women back to their homes in town, but his brothers are unwilling.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	38	47	The six women also do not want to return to their homes; they all want to stay at the farm with their new suitors and hide so they will not be taken back home.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	39	47	When Milly discovers that the women are not in the house, Adam tells his brothers to go after them and bring them back.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	40	47	The townspeople arrive with the intention of lynching the Pontipee brothers for the kidnappings.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	41	47	Upon finding the brothers trying to force the women to return, the fathers believe their daughters are being assaulted and charge to their rescue.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	42	47	Alice's father (Ian Wolfe), a preacher, hears baby Hannah cry in the distance, and worries that the baby might belong to one of the kidnapped girls.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	43	47	The fathers and other townsmen round up the Pontipees and announce they intend to hang them.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	44	47	Alice's father, the Reverend Alcott, asks the women whose baby he had heard.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	45	47	They all decide, simultaneously, to claim the baby as their own.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	46	47	This misinformation gives the women and the brothers their wish: the townspeople, including the girls' fathers, insist that all six couples marry at once in a shotgun wedding, performed by the parson while Adam and Milly watch and the fathers stand behind their daughters' grooms, shotguns over their arms.
Chasing Amy	0	30	Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck) and Banky Edwards (Jason Lee) are comic book artists and lifelong friends.

Chasing Amy	5	30	She is initially angry with him, but that night, the two begin a romantic relationship.
Chasing Amy	6	30	This new development worsens the tension between Holden and Banky, who hates and mistrusts Alyssa and is disturbed by her and Holden's relationship.
Chasing Amy	7	30	Banky investigates and uncovers dirt on Alyssa's past, and he reports to Holden that Alyssa participated in a threesome with two guys during high school, which gave her the nickname "Finger Cuffs".
Chasing Amy	8	30	Holden is deeply upset by this revelation, having previously believed that he is the first man Alyssa had ever slept with.
Chasing Amy	9	30	He angrily confronts Alyssa while attending a hockey game, and clumsily attempts baiting her into confessing.
Chasing Amy	10	30	During a tearful argument, she tells Holden about her "many" youthful sexual experimentations.
Chasing Amy	11	30	She apologizes for letting him believe that he was the only man she had been with.
Chasing Amy	12	30	However, she refuses to apologize for her past, and Holden leaves feeling disillusioned and furious.
Chasing Amy	13	30	Later, during lunch with Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), Silent Bob reveals that he was once in a relationship similar to Holden's.
Chasing Amy	14	30	Despite the fact that he was in love with his girlfriend, Amy, his neurosis about her adventurous sexual past caused him to sabotage the relationship and leave her.
Chasing Amy	15	30	Angry at himself for letting her go, he has "spent every day since then chasing Amy, so to speak".
Chasing Amy	16	30	Moved by Silent Bob's story, Holden devises a plan to fix both his relationship with Alyssa and his estranged friendship with Banky.
Chasing Amy	17	30	He invites them both over and tells Alyssa that he would like to get over her past and remain her boyfriend.
Chasing Amy	18	30	He also tells Banky that he realizes that Banky is in love with him—kissing him passionately to prove the point.
Chasing Amy	19	30	Holden suggests a threesome.
Chasing Amy	20	30	Though initially shocked, Banky agrees to participate, whereas Alyssa explains to Holden that it will not save their relationship.
Chasing Amy	21	30	Before leaving, she states that she loves him, but she will not be his "whore".
Chasing Amy	22	30	Banky also leaves the apartment, instantly ending their friendship.
Chasing Amy	23	30	One year later, both Banky and Holden are busy promoting their own respective comics at a convention in New York.
Chasing Amy	24	30	It is revealed that Holden has dissolved their partnership over Bluntman and Chronic, leaving the viewer with the assumption that he sold the publishing and creative rights over to Banky (which is corroborated in the beginning of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back).
Chasing Amy	25	30	Banky smiles sadly at seeing his old friend, who silently congratulates him for his success on his own comic.
Chasing Amy	26	30	Banky gestures over to a booth hosted by Alyssa, and provides wordless encouragement to Holden to go talk to her.
Chasing Amy	27	30	He has a brief, quietly emotional conversation with Alyssa, and gives her a copy of Chasing Amy, his new comic based on their failed relationship.
Chasing Amy	28	30	After Holden leaves, Alyssa's new girlfriend (Virginia Smith) arrives and asks who she was talking to.
Chasing Amy	29	30	A shaken, misty-eyed Alyssa feigns indifference and replies, "Oh, just some guy I knew".

Bringing Up Baby	11	25	Bone".

Bringing Up Baby	22	25	Unconsciously swaying the ladder from side to side upon hearing David's further words of endearment and love, Susan tells him that she loves him too, then notices that the ladder is on the verge of falling over.
Bringing Up Baby	23	25	Frightened, she climbs onto and over the skeleton, but just before the dinosaur bones collapse David grabs her hand, she dangles below him, and he lifts her onto the platform.
Bringing Up Baby	24	25	Regrettably surveying the wreckage of his work, David soon accepts the destruction and chaos, gives in, and hugs and kisses Susan.

Roman Holiday	0	40	Ann (Audrey Hepburn), the crown princess of an unspecified country becomes frustrated with her tightly scheduled life, and breaks down at having to repeatedly answer "yes, thank you" and "no, thank you" to demands of her time.
Roman Holiday	1	40	Her doctor gives her a sedative to calm her and help her sleep, but she secretly leaves her country's embassy.
Roman Holiday	2	40	The sedative eventually makes her fall asleep on a bench, where Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), an expatriate American reporter for the "American News Service" based in Rome, finds her.
Roman Holiday	3	40	Not recognizing her, he offers her money so she can take a taxi home, but a woozy "Anya Smith" (as she later calls herself) refuses to cooperate.
Roman Holiday	4	40	Joe finally decides, for safety's sake, to let her spend the night in his apartment.
Roman Holiday	5	40	He is amused by her regal manner, but less so when she appropriates his bed.
Roman Holiday	6	40	He transfers her to a couch.
Roman Holiday	7	40	The next morning, Joe, having already slept through the interview Princess Ann was scheduled to give, hurries off to work, leaving her still asleep.
Roman Holiday	8	40	When his editor, mr Hennessy (Hartley Power), asks why Joe is late, Joe lies, claiming to have attended the princess' press conference.
Roman Holiday	9	40	Joe makes up details of the alleged interview until Hennessy informs him that the event had been canceled because the princess had suddenly "fallen ill".
Roman Holiday	10	40	Joe sees a newspaper picture of her and realizes who is in his apartment.
Roman Holiday	11	40	Immediately seeing an opportunity, Joe proposes getting an exclusive interview.
Roman Holiday	12	40	Hennessy, not knowing the circumstances, agrees to the deal and offers $5,000 if the interview is all Joe claims it will be, but bets Joe $500 that he will not succeed.
Roman Holiday	13	40	Joe hurries home and, hiding the fact that he is a reporter, offers to show "Anya" around Rome.
Roman Holiday	14	40	He also surreptitiously calls his photographer friend, Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert), to tag along to secretly take pictures.
Roman Holiday	15	40	However, Ann declines Joe's offer and leaves.
Roman Holiday	16	40	Ann, enjoying her freedom, explores an outdoor market, buys a pair of shoes, and, on a whim, gets her long hair cut short.

Roman Holiday	18	40	This time he convinces her to spend the day with him.
Roman Holiday	19	40	They see the sights, including the "Mouth of Truth", a face carved in marble which is said to bite off the hands of liars.
Roman Holiday	20	40	When Joe shouts in mock pain and pulls his hand out of the mouth, it appears to be missing, causing Ann to scream.
Roman Holiday	21	40	He then pops his hand out of his sleeve and laughs.
Roman Holiday	22	40	(Allegedly, Hepburn's shriek was not acting&mdash;Peck decided to pull a gag he had once seen Red Skelton do, and did not tell his co-star beforehand)  Later, Ann shares with Joe her dream of living a normal life without her crushing responsibilities.

Roman Holiday	26	40	Later, knowing her royal responsibilities must resume, the princess bids a tearful farewell to Joe and returns to the embassy.
Roman Holiday	27	40	When she arrives at the embassy she is lectured upon the sense of duty she must display, but (visibly pained) retorts that without such a sense, she would never have returned.
Roman Holiday	28	40	During the course of the day, Hennessy learns that the princess is missing, not ill as claimed.
Roman Holiday	29	40	He suspects that Joe knows where she is and tries to get him to admit it, but Joe claims to know nothing about it.
Roman Holiday	30	40	Joe decides not to write the story, despite the considerable amount of money riding on it.
Roman Holiday	31	40	Irving first plans to sell his photographs independent of the story, but eventually decides against it.
Roman Holiday	32	40	The next day, Princess Ann appears to answer questions from the press, and is surprised to see Joe and Irving there.
Roman Holiday	33	40	Irving takes her picture with the same miniature cigarette-lighter/camera he had used the previous day.
Roman Holiday	34	40	When asked by a reporter which city of her European tour was her favorite, Ann first makes a diplomatic "all were equally good" answer, but interrupts it with an impulsive "Rome.
Roman Holiday	35	40	By all means, Rome".
Roman Holiday	36	40	At the end of the interview, the Princess requests to "meet" the journalists, shaking hands and making brief formal conversation.
Roman Holiday	37	40	As she reaches Joe and Irving, the latter presents her with an envelope with the photographs he had taken, under the pretext of a generic memento of Rome.
Roman Holiday	38	40	The three make several statements that hint at the truth and their dispositions, while feigning formality and the distance expected between the princess and two strange journalists.
Roman Holiday	39	40	As the interview with the princess comes to an end and she reluctantly leaves, the crowd of journalists and reporters eventually disperses, and Joe walks away alone.

The Shop Around the Corner	17	36	Later, mr Matuschek meets with a private investigator who informs him that his suspicions were correct, that his wife is having an affair with one of his employees—Ferencz Vadas.
The Shop Around the Corner	18	36	Pepi returns to the shop just in time to prevent the distraught mr Matuschek from committing suicide.
The Shop Around the Corner	19	36	Meanwhile, Kralik arrives at the Cafe Nizza, where he discovers that his mystery woman, with the red carnation as planned, is in fact Klara Novak.
The Shop Around the Corner	20	36	Despite his disappointment, Kralik goes in and talks with her, pretending he is there to meet Pirovitch.
The Shop Around the Corner	21	36	In his mind, Kralik tries to reconcile the cultured woman of his letters with his annoying coworker—secretly hoping that things might work out with her.
The Shop Around the Corner	22	36	But concerned that Kralik's presence will spoil her first meeting with her "far superior" mystery correspondent, she calls Kralik a "little insignificant clerk" and asks him to leave, and he does.
The Shop Around the Corner	23	36	Later that night, Kralik goes to the hospital to visit mr Matuschek.
The Shop Around the Corner	24	36	After apologizing for his behavior, mr Matuschek offers him a job as manager of Matuschek and Company, gives him the keys to the shop, and asks him to dismiss Vadas quietly.
The Shop Around the Corner	25	36	Kralik dismisses Vadas, loudly and publicly, pushing Vadas across the shop floor into a pile of cigarette boxes.
The Shop Around the Corner	26	36	Grateful to Pepi for saving his life, mr Matuschek promotes the errand boy to clerk.
The Shop Around the Corner	27	36	The next day, Miss Novak calls in sick after her mystery man failed to show.

The Shop Around the Corner	29	36	During his visit, she receives a letter from her correspondent and reads it in front of Kralik (who wrote the letter).
The Shop Around the Corner	30	36	Two weeks later, on Christmas Eve, Matuschek and Company achieves record sales.

The Shop Around the Corner	33	36	Finally, Rudy, the new errand boy who lives alone in the city, agrees.
The Shop Around the Corner	34	36	Kralik and Miss Novak, now alone in the shop, talk about their planned dates for the evening and Miss Novak reveals that she had a crush on Kralik when they first met, back when she was "foolish and naive".
The Shop Around the Corner	35	36	After pretending to have met Miss Novak's mystery man—whom he claims is overweight, balding, and unemployed—Kralik puts a blue carnation in his lapel and finally reveals to Miss Novak that he is in fact her mystery correspondent—her "dear friend"—and they kiss.

Tootsie	0	31	Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) is a respected but perfectionist actor.
Tootsie	1	31	Nobody in New York wants to hire him anymore because he is difficult to work with.
Tootsie	2	31	According to his long-suffering agent George Fields (Sydney Pollack), Michael's attention to detail and difficult reputation led a commercial he worked on to run significantly over-schedule, because the idea of a tomato sitting down was "illogical" to him.
Tootsie	3	31	After many months without a job, Michael hears of an opening on the popular daytime soap opera Southwest General from his friend and acting student Sandy Lester (Teri Garr), who tries out for the role of hospital administrator Emily Kimberly, but doesn't get it.
Tootsie	4	31	In desperation, and as a result of his agent telling him that "no one will hire you", he dresses as a woman, auditions as "Dorothy Michaels" and gets the part.
Tootsie	5	31	Michael takes the job as a way to raise $8,000 to produce a play, written by his roommate Jeff Slater (Bill Murray) and to star Sandy, titled Return to Love Canal.
Tootsie	6	31	Michael plays his character as a feisty, feminist administrator, which surprises the other actors and crew who expected Emily to be (as written) another swooning female in the plot.
Tootsie	7	31	His character quickly becomes a television sensation.
Tootsie	8	31	When Sandy catches Michael in her bedroom half undressed (he wanted to try on her clothes in order to get more ideas for Dorothy's outfits), he covers up by professing he wants to have sex with her.
Tootsie	9	31	They have sex despite his better judgment about her self-esteem issues.
Tootsie	10	31	Michael believes Sandy is too emotionally fragile to handle the truth about him winning the part, especially after noticing her strong resentment of Dorothy.
Tootsie	11	31	Their relationship, combined with his deception, complicates his now-busy schedule.
Tootsie	12	31	Exacerbating matters further, he is attracted to one of his co-stars, Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange), a single mother in an unhealthy relationship with the show's amoral, sexist director, Ron Carlisle (Dabney Coleman).
Tootsie	13	31	At a party, when Michael (as himself) approaches Julie with a pick-up line that she had previously told Dorothy she would be receptive towards, she throws a drink in his face.
Tootsie	14	31	Later, as Dorothy, when he makes tentative advances, Julie—having just ended her relationship with Ron per Dorothy's advice—confesses that she has feelings about Dorothy which confuse her, but is not emotionally ready to be in a romantic relationship with a woman.
Tootsie	15	31	Meanwhile, Dorothy has her own admirers to contend with: older cast member John Van Horn (George Gaynes) and Julie's widowed father Les (Charles Durning).
Tootsie	16	31	Les proposes marriage, insisting Michael/Dorothy "think about it" before answering; he leaves immediately and returns home to find co-star John, who almost forces himself on Dorothy until Jeff walks in on them.
Tootsie	17	31	John apologizes for intruding and leaves.
Tootsie	18	31	The tipping point comes when, due to Dorothy's popularity, the show's producers want to extend her contract for another year.
Tootsie	19	31	Michael finds a clever way to extricate himself.
Tootsie	20	31	When the cast is forced to perform the show live, he improvises a grand speech on camera, pulls off his wig and reveals that he is actually the character's twin brother who took her place to avenge her.
Tootsie	21	31	Sandy and Les, who are all watching at home, react with the same level of shock as the cast and crew of the show.
Tootsie	22	31	The one exception is Jeff, who was aware of his roommate's "dual role" and remarks, "That is one nutty hospital.
Tootsie	23	31	" The revelation allows everybody a more-or-less graceful way out.
Tootsie	24	31	Julie, however, is so outraged that she slugs him in the stomach in front of the cast once the cameras have stopped rolling before storming off.
Tootsie	25	31	Some weeks later, Michael is moving forward with producing Jeff's play.
Tootsie	26	31	He awkwardly makes peace with Les in a bar, and Les shows tentative support for Michael's attraction to Julie.
Tootsie	27	31	Later, Michael waits for Julie outside the studio.
Tootsie	28	31	Julie resists talking but finally admits she misses Dorothy.
Tootsie	29	31	Michael confesses, "I was a better man with you as a woman than I ever was with a woman as a man".
Tootsie	30	31	At that, she forgives him and they walk off, Julie asking him to lend her a dress.

Hannah and Her Sisters	2	33	Elliot becomes infatuated with one of Hannah's sisters, Lee (Barbara Hershey), and eventually begins an affair with her.
Hannah and Her Sisters	3	33	Elliot attributes his behavior to his discontent with his wife's self-sufficiency and resentment of her emotional strength.
Hannah and Her Sisters	4	33	Lee has lived for five years with a reclusive artist, Frederick (Max von Sydow), who is much older.
Hannah and Her Sisters	5	33	She finds her relationship with Frederick no longer intellectually or sexually stimulating, in spite of (or maybe because of) Frederick's professed interest in continuing to teach her.

Hannah and Her Sisters	29	33	They are the parents of Hannah and her two sisters, and still have acting careers of their own.

Moonstruck	1	42	Her boyfriend Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) proposes to her before leaving for Sicily to be with his dying mother; she accepts, but is insistent that they carefully follow tradition as she believes her first marriage was cursed by her failure to do so, resulting in her husband's death.
Moonstruck	2	42	Johnny asks Loretta to invite his estranged younger brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage) to the wedding.
Moonstruck	3	42	Loretta returns home and informs her parents of the engagement.

Moonstruck	6	42	He reveals that he has a wooden prosthetic hand, and he explains that he blames Johnny for the loss of his hand and his own fiancée; Ronny became distracted while talking to Johnny as he cut bread for him, his hand was mangled in the slicer, and his fiancée left him.

Moonstruck	8	42	Ronny reacts furiously and passionately, kissing Loretta (who responds to his kiss) and then carrying her to his bed where they make love.
Moonstruck	9	42	At the same time, Cosmo is dining with his mistress Mona (Anita Gillette) and giving her jewelry.
Moonstruck	10	42	That evening, Rose's brother Raymond (Louis Guss) and his wife Rita (Julie Bovasso) join Rose and Cosmo for dinner, and they all wonder where Loretta is.

Moonstruck	14	42	She slaps him when he claims to be in love with her ("Snap out of it.
Moonstruck	15	42	") and he agrees to never see her again if she will attend the opera (his other great love) with him that night.
Moonstruck	16	42	She agrees.
Moonstruck	17	42	She then goes to church and confesses her infidelity.
Moonstruck	18	42	She unexpectedly sees her mother there, and Rose tells her that Cosmo is having an affair; Loretta is doubtful.

Moonstruck	20	42	Loretta and Ronny (wearing a tuxedo) meet at Lincoln Center, and each is impressed with the other's appearance.
Moonstruck	21	42	Loretta is deeply moved by her first opera, Puccini's La bohème.
Moonstruck	22	42	But as they leave, Loretta sees Cosmo and Mona, and she confronts her father.
Moonstruck	23	42	He sees that she is with Ronny, and he suggests that they simply agree that they didn't see each other at all, but Loretta is conflicted.
Moonstruck	24	42	Loretta then intends to return home alone, but Ronny leads her back to his apartment where he passionately and desperately persuades her into another tryst.
Moonstruck	25	42	The same night, Rose dines alone at a restaurant and sees a college professor, Perry (John Mahoney), being dramatically dumped by a female student, a similar scene having played out with a different girl the night Johnny proposed to Loretta.
Moonstruck	26	42	Rose invites Perry to dine with her, asks him why men pursue women, and then shares with him her belief that men pursue women because they fear death.
Moonstruck	27	42	Perry walks Rose home and tries to convince her to invite him in; she refuses "because I'm married.
Moonstruck	28	42	Because I know who I am".
Moonstruck	29	42	Later, Johnny unexpectedly returns from Sicily after his mother's "miraculous" recovery and goes to Loretta's house; Rose explains that she's not there and then asks him why men chase women.
Moonstruck	30	42	He tells her it may be because they fear death, with which Rose agrees.
Moonstruck	31	42	After this exchange he leaves, planning to return in the morning to see Loretta.
Moonstruck	32	42	In the morning, Loretta returns home in a reverie but is then distressed to learn from Rose that Johnny will be there soon.
Moonstruck	33	42	Ronny then arrives, and Rose notes their matching "love bites" and invites him for breakfast over Loretta's objections.
Moonstruck	34	42	Cosmo and his father emerge from upstairs, and the older man cajoles Cosmo into agreeing to pay for Loretta's wedding.
Moonstruck	35	42	Rose then confronts Cosmo and, after he acknowledges in response to her questioning that she has been a good wife, demands that he end his affair; he is upset but agrees and, after insistence from Rose, also agrees to go to confession, and they then affirm their love for each other.
Moonstruck	36	42	Raymond and Rita also arrive, concerned and seemingly reluctantly suspicious, to find out why Loretta didn't make the previous day's bank deposit; they are relieved to learn that she merely forgot and still has the money.
Moonstruck	37	42	When Johnny finally arrives, he breaks off the engagement, superstitiously believing that their marriage would cause his mother's death.
Moonstruck	38	42	Loretta, momentarily offended by his breaking the engagement, chastises Johnny for breaking his promise and throws the engagement ring at him.
Moonstruck	39	42	Seizing the moment, Ronny borrows the ring and asks Loretta to marry him; she accepts.
Moonstruck	40	42	To Rose's chagrin, Loretta declares that she loves Ronny.
Moonstruck	41	42	The family toasts the couple with champagne and a befuddled Johnny joins in at the grandfather's urging, as he will now be part of the family after all.

The American President	0	34	Popular Democratic President Andrew Shepherd is preparing to run for re-election.
The American President	1	34	The President and his staff, led by Chief of Staff and best friendJ.
The American President	2	34	MacInerney, attempt to consolidate the administration's 63% approval rating by passing a moderate crime control bill.
The American President	3	34	However, support for the bill in both parties is tepid: conservatives do not want it, and liberals think it is too weak.
The American President	4	34	If it passes, however, Shepherd's re-election is presumed by his staff to be a shoo-in, and Shepherd resolves to announce the bill, and the Congressional support to pass it, by the State of the Union.
The American President	5	34	With the President of France about to arrive in the United States to attend a state dinner in his honor, Shepherd—widowed when his wife died of cancer three years earlier—is placed in an awkward predicament when his cousin Judith, with whom he had planned to attend the dinner, gets sick.
The American President	6	34	The President's attention soon focuses on Sydney Ellen Wade, just hired by an environmental lobbying firm to persuade the President to pass legislation committing his Administration to substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
The American President	7	34	During their first meeting, Shepherd and Wade are immediately intrigued by each other.
The American President	8	34	At this meeting, Shepherd strikes a deal with Wade: if she can secure 24 votes for the environmental bill by the date of the State of the Union, he will deliver the last 10 votes.
The American President	9	34	Whatever his personal feelings toward Wade, he expresses this to his staff, especially the pragmaticJ, as a sound political move.
The American President	10	34	He believes Wade will not be able to get enough votes to meet her side of the deal, thus releasing Shepherd from responsibility if the bill fails to pass.
The American President	11	34	Later that evening, in a series of phone calls, Shepherd invites Wade to the state dinner.
The American President	12	34	During the State dinner and subsequent occasions, the couple fall in love.
The American President	13	34	When the Republican presidential hopeful Senator Bob Rumson learns "the President's got a girlfriend," he steps up his attacks on Shepherd and Wade, focusing on Wade's activist past and maligning Shepherd's ethics and his family values.
The American President	14	34	The President refuses to respond to these attacks, which drives his approval ratings lower and costs him crucial political support, without which his crime bill seems doomed to failure.
The American President	15	34	At the White House Christmas Party, Wade is dejected about her meeting that day with three Congressmen from Michigan about the environmental bill and how it was a dismal failure; in the process, she inadvertently mentions to the President andJ.
The American President	16	34	that the Congressmen in question said the only bill they were more interested in defeating than the President's crime bill was Wade's environmental bill.
The American President	17	34	Shepherd andJ.
The American President	18	34	are conflicted by this information as Wade clearly had no idea of the implications of this casual conversation, much less that they might actually use this information in their favor and against her environmental bill.
The American President	19	34	Eventually, Wade does manage to get enough votes to meet her part of the deal.
The American President	20	34	However, in the meantime, Shepherd's team discovers he is exactly three votes short, with no other apparent options to acquire them except by shelving the environmental bill, thus solidifying the support of the three Congressmen from Michigan—which he agrees to do.
The American President	21	34	This results in disaster for Wade as she is immediately fired from her lobbyist job for failing to achieve her objectives, as well as seemingly jeopardizing her political reputation.
The American President	22	34	She visits the White House to break up with Shepherd and says that she has a job possibility in Hartford, Connecticut.
The American President	23	34	He tells her politics is making choices, his number-one has always been the crime control bill, and that he does not want to lose her over this.
The American President	24	34	She congratulates him on getting the leverage to pass a crime bill that in no way will help fight crime.
The American President	25	34	She concludes, "Mr.
The American President	26	34	President, you have bigger problems than losing me—you've just lost my vote".
The American President	27	34	On the morning that he is to deliver his State of the Union Address, and after an argument withJ, Shepherd makes a surprise appearance in the White House press room and rebuts Rumson's attacks on Wade's past and his own values and character.
The American President	28	34	He declares he will send the controversial environmental bill to Congress with a massive 20% cut in fossil fuels — far more than the 10% originally envisioned — and that he is withdrawing his support for the weak crime bill, promising to write a stronger one in due time.
The American President	29	34	In his speech he even promises gun control, in an attempt at root-and-branch solving of America's problems.
The American President	30	34	His passionate and erudite defense of those things in which he believes, in contrast to his earlier passive behavior, galvanizes the press and his staff.
The American President	31	34	Shepherd declares he is "going over to her house and I'm not leaving until I get her back", but Wade enters the Oval Office before he can leave.
The American President	32	34	The couple are reconciled and the President, accompanied by Wade, leaves to give his State of the Union Address.
The American President	33	34	The film ends with Shepherd entering the House chamber to thunderous applause.

The Great Race	0	37	The Great Leslie (Tony Curtis) and Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon) are competing daredevils at the turn of the 20th century.
The Great Race	1	37	Leslie is the classic hero – always dressed in white, handsome, ever-courteous, enormously talented and successful.
The Great Race	2	37	Leslie's nemesis, Fate, is the traditional melodramatic villain – usually dressed in black, sporting a black moustache and top hat, glowering at most everyone, maniacal evil laugh, grandiose plans to thwart the hero, and dogged by failure.

Lady and the Tramp	6	32	As Tramp leaves, he reminds Lady that "when the baby moves in, the dog moves out".
Lady and the Tramp	7	32	Eventually, the baby arrives and the couple introduces Lady to the infant, whom Lady grows fond of.

Gigli	0	23	Larry Gigli (Ben Affleck) is a low-ranking Los Angeles mob enforcer who isn't nearly as tough as he likes to act.
Gigli	1	23	Louis (Lenny Venito), a higher-ranking member of Gigli's organization, commands Gigli to kidnap the mentally challenged younger brother of a powerful federal prosecutor to use as a bargaining chip to save New York City-based mob boss Starkman (Al Pacino) from prison.
Gigli	2	23	Gigli successfully convinces the young man, Brian Dorf (Justin Bartha), to go off with him by promising to take him "to the Baywatch", apparently a reference to the television show of that name, which seems to be Brian's singular obsession.
Gigli	3	23	Louis, however, does not trust Gigli to do the job properly, so he hires a woman calling herself Ricki (Jennifer Lopez) to take charge.
Gigli	4	23	Despite being attracted to Ricki, Gigli resents both Louis' lack of faith in him and having to take orders from a woman.
Gigli	5	23	He is also frustrated by Brian's insistence on going to "the Baywatch" and by Ricki's lesbianism.
Gigli	6	23	A suspicious detective (Christopher Walken) comes to the apartment to question Gigli in reference to Brian's disappearance.
Gigli	7	23	Gigli is further annoyed when his mother (Lainie Kazan) takes an immediate liking to Ricki and when the two women team up to needle him.
Gigli	8	23	The events take a darker turn when Gigli and Ricki receive orders to cut off Brian's thumb, something that neither wants to do.
Gigli	9	23	Worse, Ricki's ex-girlfriend, Robin (Missy Crider), shows up at Gigli's apartment, accusing Ricki of changing sexual orientation.
Gigli	10	23	Robin slits her wrists and has to be rushed to the hospital.
Gigli	11	23	While at the hospital, Gigli goes to the morgue and cuts off a corpse's thumb, which he sends to the prosecutor as Brian's thumb.
Gigli	12	23	Gigli and Ricki go back to Gigli's apartment, where Gigli confesses his love and the two sleep together.
Gigli	13	23	The next morning, they are summoned to meet with the mob's boss.
Gigli	14	23	Starkman reveals that he did not approve of the plan to kidnap a federal prosecutor's brother or the order to cut off Brian's thumb.
Gigli	15	23	He nevertheless rages at them because the thumb they sent didn't match Brian's fingerprint and therefore not only failed to increase pressure on the prosecutor but even undermined the organization's credibility.
Gigli	16	23	Starkman then kills Louis, presumably in retaliation for the kidnapping and associated scrutiny by law enforcement.
Gigli	17	23	Starkman is about to kill Ricki and Gigli as well, but Ricki talks him out of it by pointing out that only they know where Brian is and only they can silence Brian and prevent him from revealing the involvement of Starkman's organization in the kidnapping or even accusing Starkman of having been personally involved.
Gigli	18	23	They leave Starkman's home, decide to leave the mob, and discuss taking Brian back to where they found him.
Gigli	19	23	On the way, they discover Baywatch (or a similarly themed show or film) shooting an episode on the beach.
Gigli	20	23	Brian begs to be let off there and finally they consent.
Gigli	21	23	Gigli convinces Ricki to take his car, but at the last minute, Ricki returns and picks up Gigli, and they leave town together.

No Exit	2	24	At first, none of them will admit the reason for their damnation: Joseph says that he was executed for being a pacifist, while Estelle insists that a mistake has been made; Inès, however, is the only one to demand that they all stop lying to themselves and confess to their moral crimes.

50 First Dates	0	41	Henry Roth is a veterinarian at Sea Life Park on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.
50 First Dates	1	41	He has a reputation of womanizing female tourists and does not display any interest in committing to a serious relationship.
50 First Dates	2	41	Henry's closest friends are Ula, a marijuana-smoking Islander; his assistant Alexa, whose gender is unclear; Willy, his pet African penguin; and Jocko, a walrus.
50 First Dates	3	41	One day Henry’s boat breaks down while he is sailing around Oahu.
50 First Dates	4	41	He goes to the Hukilau Café to wait for the Coast Guard.
50 First Dates	5	41	There he sees a young woman named Lucy Whitmore, who makes architectural art with her waffles.
50 First Dates	6	41	Henry thinks she is a local, which prevents him from introducing himself, but the next day he comes back.
50 First Dates	7	41	Lucy and he hit it off instantly and she asks him to meet her again tomorrow morning.
50 First Dates	8	41	When Henry goes back to the café, Lucy does not have any recollection of ever meeting him.
50 First Dates	9	41	The restaurant owner Sue (Amy Hill) explains to Henry that one year ago, Lucy and her father Marlin went up to the North Shore to pick a pineapple for his birthday.
50 First Dates	10	41	On the way back, they had a serious car accident that left Lucy with anterograde amnesia and she wakes up every morning thinking it is October 13, 2002.
50 First Dates	11	41	To save her the heartbreak of reliving the accident every day, Marlin and Doug, Lucy's lisping steroid-addicted brother, re-enact Marlin's birthday by following a script, including putting out October 13's Sunday newspaper, rewatching the same Minnesota Vikings game, and refilling Lucy's shampoo bottles.
50 First Dates	12	41	Despite Sue's warning, Henry invites Lucy to have breakfast with him.
50 First Dates	13	41	Eventually she does, but it ends poorly when Henry unintentionally hurts Lucy’s feelings.
50 First Dates	14	41	He follows her home to apologize where Marlin and Doug instruct Henry to leave Lucy alone.
50 First Dates	15	41	Henry begins concocting ways to run into Lucy on the following days, such as pretending to have car trouble, creating a fake road block, or by having Ula beat him up.
50 First Dates	16	41	Eventually, Marlin and Doug figure this out due to Lucy singing The Beach Boys' "Wouldn't It Be Nice" on the days when she meets Henry.

50 First Dates	19	41	When she rushes home, Marlin and Doug are forced to admit their ruse (and presumably not for the first time; when Marlin sees Lucy's frantic behavior as her truck pulls up to the house, he immediately realizes what happened and loudly announces to Doug that Lucy "had a bad day").
50 First Dates	20	41	Henry comes up with an idea to make a video explaining to Lucy her accident and their relationship.
50 First Dates	21	41	Although Lucy is upset over understanding about her accident and memory loss, Henry believes that she is more upset realizing her life is a lie every day.
50 First Dates	22	41	Because of this, Henry, Marlin and Doug show Lucy the tape every morning and help her spend her days by picking up where the tape says she left off.
50 First Dates	23	41	She spends more time with Henry and goes to see some of her old friends.
50 First Dates	24	41	Lucy decides to erase Henry completely from her life after learning of his decision not to take a sailing trip to Bristol Bay to study walruses, something he has been planning for the past 10 years.
50 First Dates	25	41	Although Henry would rather spend that year making Lucy fall in love with him everyday rather than go on the sailing trip, Lucy is convinced she is a burden on him and is preventing Henry from really living his life.
50 First Dates	26	41	Henry reluctantly helps Lucy destroy her journal entries of their relationship.
50 First Dates	27	41	A few weeks later, Henry is preparing to leave for his sailing trip.
50 First Dates	28	41	Before he departs, Marlin tells him that Lucy is now living at the brain institute and teaching an art class.
50 First Dates	29	41	He also tells him that she sings.
50 First Dates	30	41	Then he gives Henry a Beach Boys CD.
50 First Dates	31	41	Listening to the CD, Henry becomes emotional and curses Marlin for giving him the CD and causing him to miss Lucy.
50 First Dates	32	41	He then remembers that Marlin once told him that Lucy only sings after she meets him.
50 First Dates	33	41	Concluding that Lucy remembers him, he returns home.
50 First Dates	34	41	Henry rushes to the brain institute where Lucy now resides and asks if she knows who he is.
50 First Dates	35	41	Lucy says she does not know him but shows him the pictures she has painted of him, saying she dreams about him every night.
50 First Dates	36	41	Some time later, Lucy wakes up and plays a video tape marked "Good Morning Lucy".
50 First Dates	37	41	It again informs her of her accident, but ends with her and Henry’s wedding.

Real Genius	7	37	Arriving on campus, Mitch meets Chris and is disappointed to learn that he is an irreverent slacker who spends his time pulling elaborate high tech pranks.
Real Genius	8	37	Mitch also meets Jordan, a hyperkinetic female student, "Ick" Ikagami, a brilliant and affable foil to Chris's antics, and the mysterious Lazlo Hollyfeld, a middle-aged man who seems to be living in Mitch's closet.

Real Genius	15	37	Chris tells Mitch that if he does not want to "crack" like Hollyfeld, he must learn to have fun, and the first order of business is to get even with Kent, calling it a "moral imperative" to do so.

Real Genius	24	37	The beam of the redesigned laser has unlimited range and produces an estimated six megawatts of power, exceeding the original requirement.
Real Genius	25	37	While the team celebrates its success, Lazlo insists that the high-energy laser can only be used as a weapon, and in fact that it must have been conceived for this purpose.
Real Genius	26	37	Chris is devastated.
Real Genius	27	37	Hathaway has removed the laser from the lab.
Real Genius	28	37	Chris, Mitch, Ick and Jordan trick Kent into revealing the date when the laser is going to be tested by placing a microphone in his braces and convincing him that God is talking to him.

Real Genius	30	37	While Chris and Mitch talk their way onto the base, Lazlo remotely cracks the laser's computer and changes its target coordinates to Hathaway's house, where the team has placed a huge tin of popcorn.
Real Genius	31	37	Meanwhile, Chris and Mitch remove circuits that prevent the laser from overheating.
Real Genius	32	37	When the laser beam hits the house, it is diffused by a prism placed by Chris and the popcorn heats and expands; the house bursts at the seams as popcorn pours out onto the lawn.
Real Genius	33	37	Kent "rides" the flowing popcorn out of the front door unharmed and laughing, thinking the incident was religious in nature.

Strictly Ballroom	3	26	Scott's mother Shirley teaches ballroom dancing, and his father Doug meekly handles maintenance chores at the dance studio.
Strictly Ballroom	4	26	After losing a competition to a rival pair, because Scott started dancing his own steps, his dancing partner Liz Holt (Gia Carides) leaves him for the rival male, Ken Railings, after his partner Pam Short breaks both her legs in a car accident.
Strictly Ballroom	5	26	With only weeks before the next Pan-Pacific competition, try-outs begin to find Scott a new dance partner but, unknown to his parents, Scott secretly begins rehearsing with frumpy outsider Fran (Tara Morice), a beginner dancer at his parents' studio.
Strictly Ballroom	6	26	Scott is initially sceptical, but when Fran introduces pasodoble steps into their routine, Scott realises her potential.
Strictly Ballroom	7	26	He walks her home one night and finds her Spanish family living in a tiny home next to the railway tracks, where Fran's family show him the authentic Spanish pasodoble style.
Strictly Ballroom	8	26	As their rehearsals progress, Fran grows more attractive and self-confident.
Strictly Ballroom	9	26	A few days before the Pan-Pacifics, Fran's family decide they are ready to dance pasodoble.
Strictly Ballroom	10	26	Scott and Fran are walking together and talking until they kiss, as they were already in love.
Strictly Ballroom	11	26	When Scott returns to the dance studio, he finds Barry Fife, the conniving president of the Australian Dancing Federation who proceeds to tell him "the truth" about his parents, Doug and Shirley — they too were ballroom dancing champions, especially his father, until they lost the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix because of Doug's self-obsession and unorthodox dance steps.
Strictly Ballroom	12	26	According to Barry losing the contest left Doug a broken man, sustained by the hope that one day his son would learn from his father's mistakes and win the Grand Prix.
Strictly Ballroom	13	26	Scott is convinced to dance with Liz instead of Fran so he can win "for his father's sake".
Strictly Ballroom	14	26	However, this is later revealed as a lie, part of Barry's plot to fix the competition so Scott and Liz will lose.
Strictly Ballroom	15	26	Scott starts training with Liz, while a heart-broken Fran goes back to the beginners' class.
Strictly Ballroom	16	26	At the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix, Scott's friend Wayne Burns and his partner Vanessa Cronin overhear Fife talking to Ken and his partner Tina Sparkle saying that they will win no matter what.
Strictly Ballroom	17	26	Wayne tells Les Kendall (Scott's coach, Doug and Shirley's friend and one of the judges) who then confronts Fife about it.
Strictly Ballroom	18	26	Meanwhile, Doug finally manages to pull Scott aside and tells him the real story — Doug never danced at the competition because Barry convinced Shirley the only way to win was to dance the conventional steps with Les, but Shirley and Les lost the contest anyway.
Strictly Ballroom	19	26	After hearing his father's revelation, Scott finds Fran and asks her to dance with him.
Strictly Ballroom	20	26	Fife tries to cut the music and stop them from dancing but Scott's sister Kylie and her partner Luke (from the children's division) interfere until Fife's loyal companion Charm Leachman cuts the music.
Strictly Ballroom	21	26	Fife then disqualifies them, but Doug, along with Fran's family, claps out a beat which encourages Scott and Fran to "dance from the heart", drawing cheers from the crowd and tears of joy from Doug.
Strictly Ballroom	22	26	Finally, Liz, having had a change of heart, turns on Barry and Leachman and restores the music.
Strictly Ballroom	23	26	The couple's spirited dancing brings down the house.
Strictly Ballroom	24	26	Doug asks Shirley to dance with him and the whole audience joins them on the floor.
Strictly Ballroom	25	26	As the performance finishes, Scott and Fran kiss, the competition forgotten, as it was never about winning or losing.

Mr. Deeds	0	22	Multibillionaire Preston Blake freezes to death while on a mountain climbing expedition.
Mr. Deeds	1	22	With no widow or legitimate children, it is initially unclear who would earn the right to Blake's massive fortune.

Mr. Deeds	5	22	Once Deeds arrives in New York, plans are made for him to sell his shares in the company to Cedar and return home $40 billion richer, but he must remain in New York for a few days while all the legal details are worked out.
Mr. Deeds	6	22	The story is major news, and reporter Babe Bennett (Winona Ryder), who works for a tabloid show called Inside Access, has a co-worker pretend to steal her purse in sight of Deeds, because their research indicated that Deeds wanted to meet a girl by "rescuing" her, the same way his father had met his mother.
Mr. Deeds	7	22	Deeds does so, and beats up her "robber", and Babe goes out with him under the disguise of Pam Dawson, a school nurse from a made-up town called Winchestertonfieldville, Iowa (which later turns out to be a real town, which Babe is flabbergasted to find out).
Mr. Deeds	8	22	Though Babe initially hopes to just get a good story on the new heir, she eventually falls for the unfailingly kind-hearted Deeds, and decides to tell him that she is not who she says she is, but Inside Access, in concert with Cedar (who was fed the truth by the fake robber and was smitten with Babe) reveals it to Deeds first.

Mr. Deeds	10	22	After returning to Mandrake Falls, he learns from Crazy Eyes (Steve Buscemi) that Cedar intends to sell off the company, which will cause thousands of people to lose their jobs (Cedar had convinced Longfellow to sell his shares by lying that he will work commanding the company in honor of Preston's lifetime of work).

Mr. Deeds	12	22	At a shareholders meeting, Cedar has everyone convinced to sell the company, until Deeds (who has bought a single share) arrives and manages to convince everyone not to sell.
Mr. Deeds	13	22	But Cedar claims control of a majority of the shares and the sale is approved.
Mr. Deeds	14	22	Bennett arrives and reveals that Emilio Lopez, Preston Blake's longtime butler is his illegitimate son and the true heir as a result of a younger Preston having an amorous affair with his maid in 1958 (at one point he had told Deeds that Blake treated him "like a son").
Mr. Deeds	15	22	Realizing Emilio is his cousin, Deeds convinces him they must stop Cedar and that he is the rightful CEO.
Mr. Deeds	16	22	As a result of Emilio supplanting Longfellow as the heir, Deeds' sale of shares are retracted and Cedar is fired.
Mr. Deeds	17	22	Emilio immediately takes control of Blake Media.
Mr. Deeds	18	22	Babe then reconciles with and kisses Deeds after professing her love for him.
Mr. Deeds	19	22	As they leave the meeting, Emilio thanks Deeds for his support and offers him a billion dollars, some of which Deeds spends on red Corvettes for everyone in Mandrake Falls.
Mr. Deeds	20	22	When he returns to the pizzeria with Babe, he learns that Hallmark is interested in buying one of his greeting cards: the one he wrote for Babe when he professed his love for her.

13 Going on 30	0	30	On May 26, 1987, Jenna Rink, a gawky girl, yearns to be popular, but the only way she can get the ruling clique - the "Six Chicks," led by the arrogant Lucy "Tom-Tom" Wyman - to attend her upcoming 13th birthday party is by doing their homework.
13 Going on 30	1	30	Jenna's best friend, the geeky boy Matty Flamhaff, (with the horrible nickname of Beaver because he looks like the star of "Leave It To Beaver") arrives early to the party to give her a bright pink, dream dollhouse that he built for her.
13 Going on 30	2	30	He sprinkles his second gift, a packet of glittery "magic wishing dust".
13 Going on 30	3	30	on its roof.
13 Going on 30	4	30	The Six Chicks soon show up with the cutest boys in class and make Jenna play "Seven Minutes in Heaven" While Jenna waits, blindfolded, in a dark closet, thinking a popular boy she has a crush on is about to enter, the Six Chicks vanish with all the boys, half the food and Jenna's completed homework.
13 Going on 30	5	30	It's Matt who walks into the closet, to Jenna's horror.
13 Going on 30	6	30	She locks herself in the closet and cries, wishing to be 30; above her, the glittering wishing dust from the dollhouse gently rains down.
13 Going on 30	7	30	The next morning, Jenna awakens in a gleaming Fifth Avenue apartment.
13 Going on 30	8	30	Jenna's dream has come true: It is now 2004, and Jenna, at first utterly baffled, particularly by the handsome hunk in her shower, realises she's magically turned thirty overnight, with no idea of what happened in the intervening seventeen years.
13 Going on 30	9	30	Jenna discovers that she works for Poise, her favourite fashion magazine.
13 Going on 30	10	30	Tough-as-nails Lucy is her co-editor and best friend, but the magazine itself is in serious trouble, having been scooped by a rival magazine named Sparkle so often that the editor-in-chief believes someone inside Poise is tipping them off.

13 Going on 30	12	30	She gets his address and races down to the Village where the now-grown Matt (Mark Ruffalo) is a struggling photographer.
13 Going on 30	13	30	To her confusion, he's distant and cold, and can't even fill Jenna on much of her missing past, because she became head of the "Six Chicks," and never spoke to Matt again.
13 Going on 30	14	30	She even became Prom Queen - and Lucy, her only friend, is actually the original "Tom-Tom' after plastic surgery.
13 Going on 30	15	30	While delighting in her freedom and great clothes, Jenna stumbles through a grown-up world, learning enough of life to advise other 13-year-olds whom she actually prefers to hang with.
13 Going on 30	16	30	But her slowly-emerging past reveals she was nothing like the sweet, shy girl she'd been the day before: this grown-up Jenna stole ideas, refused to speak to her parents, has office sex with the husband of a co-worker.
13 Going on 30	17	30	After Jenna overhears her supposed best friend Lucy badmouthing her, in a plan to save the magazine behind her back, she resolves to fix the sins of the past she can't remember.

13 Going on 30	19	30	Her parents find her there, and they hug.
13 Going on 30	20	30	She gets back in touch with Matt, gingerly apologises and hires him to do the photography on her own new plans for Poise, which is a huge break for him.
13 Going on 30	21	30	Even though Matt has a fiancée in Chicago who's eager for him to move there, Jenna and Matt begin to fall for each other.
13 Going on 30	22	30	Everyone loves Matt's photos and Jenna's new plans to save the magazine, but when Sparkle shows up yet again with this exact material, including Matt's own photographs, and with Lucy as their new head, Poise folds.
13 Going on 30	23	30	Outraged, Jenna confronts Lucy for stealing, but Lucy scornfully tells her that Jenna was the one sabotaging her own magazine all along; Lucy merely found out about it and did the same thing.
13 Going on 30	24	30	Matt, wounded by what he thought was Jenna's betrayal of him, is getting married the next day.
13 Going on 30	25	30	Jenna rushes out to the leafy suburb on his wedding day, hoping to convince Matt that she wasn't the person she'd seemed to be, that he'd marry her if he could see who she really was, but Matt, already in his tux, says the past can't come back and hands Jenna her pink homemade dollhouse, which he'd kept all these years.
13 Going on 30	26	30	While the wedding begins in the background, Jenna leaves in tears, closing her eyes and clinging to the dollhouse -- on which a few bits of wishing dust still remain.
13 Going on 30	27	30	When Jenna opens her eyes, she's back in 1987, on that same 13th birthday night.
13 Going on 30	28	30	This time, when Matt finds her huddled alone in the closet, she kisses him.
13 Going on 30	29	30	They run upstairs together, bumping into Tom-Tom on the way, Jenna rips up the homework in Tom-Tom's hands and Jenna and Matt run out of the house, emerging as a wedding couple on the other side of the door, and, as credits roll, they're moving into a bright pink house just like the dollhouse that started it all.

The Terminal	0	32	Viktor Navorski, a traveler from Krakozhia, arrives at New York's John Kennedy International Airport, only to find that his passport is suddenly no longer valid due to the sudden outbreak of a civil war in his homeland.
The Terminal	1	32	As a result, the United States no longer recognizes Krakozhia as a sovereign nation, and he is no longer permitted to either enter the country or return home as he is now considered to be stateless.
The Terminal	2	32	Due to his inability to communicate in proper English, the airport's branch of the US Customs and Border Protection seize both his passport and airline ticket, whereupon its temporary director, Frank Dixon, makes him stay in the terminal he came through.
The Terminal	3	32	Left with no other choice, Viktor decides to settle in at a closed off section of the terminal, Gate 67, with only his luggage and a peanut can, soon making a home out of it.
The Terminal	4	32	Much to the frustration of Dixon, who is being considered for promotion to director of the US Customs branch, Viktor chooses not to break out of the terminal but wait patiently until he can legally enter the United States.
The Terminal	5	32	Dixon, who wants him to illegally attempt to enter the country so he can deport him, decides to try finding ways to make it difficult for him to survive in the terminal, slowly becoming obsessed in doing so.
The Terminal	6	32	During his initial days at the terminal, Viktor encounters and helps out a flight attendant named Amelia Warren after she slips on a wet floor and breaks the heel of her shoes, who assumes he is a contractor of sorts from the pager he was given by Customs but is surprised by his respectful kindness to her.
The Terminal	7	32	When Viktor is unable to secure himself some food after Dixon cuts him off from an avenue of money, his plight is noticed by a food service worker at the airport, Enrique Cruz, who offers him food in exchange for helping in learning more about an immigration officer that he is infatuated with, Dolores Torres.
The Terminal	8	32	After meeting with Amelia once again and wanting to take her out for a meal, Viktor begins improving his English while attempting to find work, and is soon hired by an airport contractor and paid under the table after he impulsively remodeled a wall at a gate that was scheduled for future renovation.
The Terminal	9	32	During this time, he also befriends some of Enrique's friends whom he plays poker with, including a cargo handler named Joe Mulroy, and an Indian janitor named Gupta Rajan, learning from the latter that he had come to the States in order to avoid being arrested for stabbing a corrupt police officer back in India in 1979.
The Terminal	10	32	When a Russian traveler creates a delicate situation when Customs try to remove the medicine he is carrying for his father, Dixon is annoyed when Viktor, whom he uses to persuade the man to leave the medicine behind, claims he misheard his Krakozhian dialect for "father" as "goat" so the traveler can leave with them.
The Terminal	11	32	Shortly after the traveler leaves, Dixon strong-arms him over a photocopier, nearly blowing his chance for promotion, before later promising Viktor that he will never let him leave the airport.
The Terminal	12	32	When the airport employees hear from Gupta of the incident in customs with the Russian and what Viktor did, Viktor finds himself respected and admired for his kind-hearted actions, with many stores showing off photocopied images of his hand that had been accidentally made.
The Terminal	13	32	When Viktor meets with Amelia once again and takes her out for a meal, he slowly begins taking an interest with her, even wooing her, before offering to surprise her with a gift when she returns, based on his recent knowledge of Napoleon, soon creating a majestic fountain.
The Terminal	14	32	After helping Enrique finally marry Torres, Viktor awaits the arrival of Amelia.
The Terminal	15	32	Unbeknown to him, Dixon pulls her aside to question her about Viktor, revealing his true situation in the process.
The Terminal	16	32	Feeling that he lied to her, Amelia confronts Viktor in Gate 67, shocked at his predicament, and tries to learn why he came to New York.
The Terminal	17	32	Agreeing to tell her, Viktor reveals the contents of the peanut can he was carrying, explaining that his late father, a jazz enthusiast, had discovered the famous portrait, "A Great Day in Harlem", in a Hungarian newspaper in 1958, where after spending a week looking at it, he vowed he would collect the signatures of all 57 of the jazz musicians featured on it.
The Terminal	18	32	Viktor reveals that the can contains not only a copy of the portrait, but the autographs of all the musicians his father received, but one - tenor saxophonist Benny Golson.
The Terminal	19	32	After his father died, Viktor had promised to collect the last signature by coming to New York to find Golson.
The Terminal	20	32	After hearing his story, Amelia kisses Viktor.
The Terminal	21	32	After having spent nine months in the terminal, Viktor is awakened by his friends who give him news that the war in Krakozhia has ended.
The Terminal	22	32	Overjoyed, he celebrates in an airport bar, where Amelia meets with him and explains that a man she had been having an affair with, a government official, helped her to secure Viktor with a one-day emergency visa to fulfill his dream.
The Terminal	23	32	While delighted, Viktor is saddened when he learns that her "friend" did so in order to renew their relationship.
The Terminal	24	32	Despite this, Viktor heads off to Customs with renewed hope of going to New York, only to find that Dixon must sign the visa.
The Terminal	25	32	Seizing the opportunity, Dixon instructs Viktor to go home to Krakozhia, threatening to cause trouble for Viktor's friends by deporting them if he refuses.
The Terminal	26	32	Unwilling to let that happen, he agrees to do so, despite his friends offering to prevent this happening.
The Terminal	27	32	When Gupta, assuming he was acting a coward, learns of the situation he was put into, he decides to take the burden off Viktor by running in front of the plane to Krakozhia as it taxies to the terminal, choosing to let himself be deported back to his home country in order to let his friend go to New York.
The Terminal	28	32	Dixon, shocked by this, attempts to stop Viktor leaving as he receives gifts from employees for his trip into the city, but is thwarted by his Custom agents, who allow him to leave.
The Terminal	29	32	As Viktor leaves, seeing Amelia once more before taking a taxi, Dixon decides to finally not pursue him further.
The Terminal	30	32	Meanwhile, Viktor arrives in New York at the hotel where Benny Golson is performing, and finally collects the last autograph.
The Terminal	31	32	As he steps into a taxi and places the last signature into the can, he soon tells the driver, "I am going home".

Empire Records	0	46	Empire Records is an independent record shop managed by Joe (Anthony LaPaglia).
Empire Records	1	46	The store is located in a fictional city in Delaware, and, like its employees, is eclectic and unique.
Empire Records	2	46	The staff is very much a surrogate family, with Joe as the reluctant and perpetually exasperated but lovable father figure.
Empire Records	3	46	When his young staff experience problems in their personal lives, he routinely reminds them they can seek him out for advice.
Empire Records	4	46	The film opens with store manager Joe allowing employee Lucas (Rory Cochrane) his first opportunity to close the store, an opportunity Lucas regards as an honor.
Empire Records	5	46	While counting the day's receipts in Joe's office, Lucas snoops and discovers that Empire Records is about to be bought and converted into a branch of Music Town, a large national music store with many franchises.
Empire Records	6	46	In an effort to keep the store independent, Lucas takes the day's cash receipts totaling $9,000 to a casino in Atlantic City in an attempt to quadruple it via gambling.
Empire Records	7	46	Lucas believes this act will create enough money to allow Joe to save Empire Records.
Empire Records	8	46	Though initially doubling the money, Lucas soon loses the entire amount in one bet on a dice table.
Empire Records	9	46	Instead of going home he sleeps on his motorcycle outside the store, where he is found the following morning by opening managerJ.
Empire Records	10	46	(Johnny Whitworth) and fellow employee Mark (Ethan Embry).
Empire Records	11	46	He confides in the pair about the previous night's events before riding away, seemingly for good.
Empire Records	12	46	Joe arrives to help open the store and quickly receives phone calls from both the bank and the store owner, Mitchell Beck (Ben Bodé), regarding the previous night's missing deposit.
Empire Records	13	46	Joe is distracted from immediately dealing with this crisis due to a scheduled store event: Rex Manning (Maxwell Caulfield), a former 80's pop idol, is due to arrive at the store for an autograph session to promote his new album.
Empire Records	14	46	The staff is unenthused by "Rex Manning Day", and ultimately many of the fans showing up to meet him are either older women or gay men.
Empire Records	15	46	The employees secretly tease Rex behind his back about his fading career, and even his assistant Jane (Debi Mazar) later reveals her distaste for Rex's music.
Empire Records	16	46	Lucas returns after the store opens and Joe confronts him about the missing deposit.
Empire Records	17	46	After telling him of his short misadventure, Lucas is asked to stay in the store until a plan is devised to recoup the lost $9,000.
Empire Records	18	46	Joe explains that he had intended to use the money to invest and become part-owner of the store, which would allow him the opportunity of saving it from becoming a Music Town franchise.
Empire Records	19	46	Next to arrive are cashiers Corey (Liv Tyler), an overachieving high school student, and her uninhibited best friend and co-worker Gina (Renée Zellweger), both of whom are informed of the situation.
Empire Records	20	46	Soon thereafter arrives hostile employee Deb (Robin Tunney), who is in a particularly bad state of mind; she has survived an apparent suicide attempt and immediately shaves her head in the bathroom upon arriving at work.
Empire Records	21	46	Deb's boyfriend Berko (Coyote Shivers) soon arrives as well.
Empire Records	22	46	The afternoon continues in a downward spiral.
Empire Records	23	46	A young belligerent shoplifter who identifies himself only as "Warren Beatty" (Brendan Sexton III) is apprehended by Lucas and subsequently arrested, promising to return for revenge.
Empire Records	24	46	Encouraged by Gina, Corey's school-girl crush on Rex is pushed to its limits—much to the horror of her friends, includingJ, who is infatuated with her.
Empire Records	25	46	This leads to the revelation that Corey is secretly using Amphetamines.
Empire Records	26	46	After arguing with Corey, Gina has sex with Rex Manning, causing the rift between the two friends to intensify and Rex to get kicked out of the store by Joe.
Empire Records	27	46	Deb takes Corey aside and advises her on the questionable choices she is making, choices which may have dire consequences on her bright future.
Empire Records	28	46	In return, Corey holds a mock funeral for Deb and the whole store attends.
Empire Records	29	46	Gina then apologizes to Corey.
Empire Records	30	46	The pugnacious "Warren Beatty" keeps his word and returns to the store with a gun (loaded with blanks) to seek revenge.
Empire Records	31	46	Lucas reveals that he was once a troubled youth much like "Warren" until he was taken in by Joe, who gave him a home and a job and helped him turn his life around.
Empire Records	32	46	The staff surmises that "Warren" just needs a similar chance.
Empire Records	33	46	Joe subsequently offers him a job at the store.
Empire Records	34	46	After the police leave, Lucas admits defeat, and suggests calling Mitchell.
Empire Records	35	46	However, the employees, Joe, and Jane — who has since quit working for Rex — pool their resources to replace the missing money.
Empire Records	36	46	Despite their best efforts, they are thousands short.
Empire Records	37	46	Suddenly inspired, Mark runs out of the store, jumps in front of a news crew covering the holdup, and announces a late night benefit party to "Save the Empire".
Empire Records	38	46	The store opens its doors and collects donations while selling food, drinks, and merchandise to raise the remaining money.
Empire Records	39	46	They manage to raise just enough, which they offer to store owner Mitchell.
Empire Records	40	46	Mitchell in turn offers to sell the store to Joe, admitting that Joe has always loved the place while he himself has always hated it.
Empire Records	41	46	Joe agrees to become the new owner.
Empire Records	42	46	Corey meets up with a dejectedJ on the roof and confesses that she does love him.
Empire Records	43	46	He tells her he has decided to attend art school in Boston so he can be near her when she goes to Harvard.
Empire Records	44	46	They then kiss.
Empire Records	45	46	In celebration of maintaining Empire Records' independence and their victory against "the man", the staff ends the long and eventful day with a dance party on the store's roof.

An Ideal Husband	0	44	The play opens during a dinner party at the home of Sir Robert Chiltern in London's fashionable Grosvenor Square.
An Ideal Husband	1	44	Sir Robert, a prestigious member of the House of Commons, and his wife, Lady Chiltern, are hosting a gathering that includes his friend Lord Goring, a dandified bachelor and close friend to the Chilterns, Mabel Chiltern, and other genteel guests.
An Ideal Husband	2	44	During the party, mrs Cheveley, an enemy of Lady Chiltern's from their school days, attempts to blackmail Sir Robert into supporting a fraudulent scheme to build a canal in Argentina.
An Ideal Husband	3	44	Apparently, mrs Cheveley's dead mentor and lover, Baron Arnheim, convinced the young Sir Robert to sell him a Cabinet secret, a secret that suggested he buy stocks in the Suez Canal three days before the British government announced its purchase.
An Ideal Husband	4	44	Sir Robert made his fortune with that illicit money, and mrs Cheveley has the letter to prove his crime.
An Ideal Husband	5	44	Fearing the ruin of both career and marriage, Sir Robert submits to her demands.
An Ideal Husband	6	44	When mrs Cheveley pointedly informs Lady Chiltern of Sir Robert's change of heart regarding the canal scheme, the morally inflexible Lady Chiltern, unaware of both her husband's past and the blackmail plot, insists that Sir Robert renege on his promise.
An Ideal Husband	7	44	For Lady Chiltern, their marriage is predicated on her having an "ideal husband"—that is, a model spouse in both private and public life that she can worship: thus Sir Robert must remain unimpeachable in all his decisions.
An Ideal Husband	8	44	Sir Robert complies with the lady's wishes and apparently seals his doom.
An Ideal Husband	9	44	Also toward the end of Act&nbsp;I, Mabel and Lord Goring come upon a diamond brooch that Lord Goring gave someone many years ago.
An Ideal Husband	10	44	Goring takes the brooch and asks that Mabel inform him if anyone comes to retrieve it.
An Ideal Husband	11	44	In the second act, which also takes place at Sir Robert's house, Lord Goring urges Sir Robert to fight mrs Cheveley and admit his guilt to his wife.
An Ideal Husband	12	44	He also reveals that he and mrs Cheveley were formerly engaged.
An Ideal Husband	13	44	After finishing his conversation with Sir Robert, Goring engages in flirtatious banter with Mabel.
An Ideal Husband	14	44	He also takes Lady Chiltern aside and obliquely urges her to be less morally inflexible and more forgiving.
An Ideal Husband	15	44	Once Goring leaves, mrs Cheveley appears, unexpected, in search of a brooch she lost the previous evening.
An Ideal Husband	16	44	Incensed at Sir Robert's reneging on his promise, she ultimately exposes Sir Robert to his wife once they are both in the room.
An Ideal Husband	17	44	Unable to accept a Sir Robert now unmasked, Lady Chiltern then denounces her husband and refuses to forgive him.
An Ideal Husband	18	44	In the third act, set in Lord Goring's home, Goring receives a pink letter from Lady Chiltern asking for his help, a letter that might be read as a compromising love note.
An Ideal Husband	19	44	Just as Goring receives this note, however, his father, Lord Caversham, drops in and demands to know when his son will marry.
An Ideal Husband	20	44	A visit from Sir Robert, who seeks further counsel from Goring, follows.
An Ideal Husband	21	44	Meanwhile, mrs Cheveley arrives unexpectedly and, misrecognised by the butler as the woman Goring awaits, is ushered into Lord Goring's drawing room.
An Ideal Husband	22	44	While she waits, she finds Lady Chiltern's letter.
An Ideal Husband	23	44	Ultimately, Sir Robert discovers mrs Cheveley in the drawing room and, convinced of an affair between these two former lovers, angrily storms out of the house.
An Ideal Husband	24	44	When she and Lord Goring confront each other, mrs Cheveley makes a proposal.
An Ideal Husband	25	44	Claiming to still love Goring from their early days of courtship, she offers to exchange Sir Robert's letter for her old beau's hand in marriage.
An Ideal Husband	26	44	Lord Goring declines, accusing her of defiling love by reducing courtship to a vulgar transaction and ruining the Chilterns' marriage.
An Ideal Husband	27	44	He then springs his trap.
An Ideal Husband	28	44	Removing the diamond brooch from his desk drawer, he binds it to Cheveley's wrist with a hidden lock.
An Ideal Husband	29	44	Goring then reveals how the item came into her possession.
An Ideal Husband	30	44	Apparently mrs Cheveley stole it from his cousin, Mary Berkshire, years ago.
An Ideal Husband	31	44	To avoid arrest, Cheveley must trade the incriminating letter for her release from the bejewelled handcuff.
An Ideal Husband	32	44	After Goring obtains and burns the letter, however, mrs Cheveley steals Lady Chiltern's note from his desk.
An Ideal Husband	33	44	Vengefully she plans to send it to Sir Robert misconstrued as a love letter addressed to the dandified lord.
An Ideal Husband	34	44	mrs Cheveley exits the house in triumph.
An Ideal Husband	35	44	The final act, which returns to Grosvenor Square, resolves the many plot complications sketched above with a decidedly happy ending.
An Ideal Husband	36	44	Lord Goring proposes to and is accepted by Mabel.
An Ideal Husband	37	44	Lord Caversham informs his son that Sir Robert has denounced the Argentine canal scheme before the House.
An Ideal Husband	38	44	Lady Chiltern then appears, and Lord Goring informs her that Sir Robert's letter has been destroyed but that mrs Cheveley has stolen her letter and plans to use it to destroy her marriage.
An Ideal Husband	39	44	At that moment, Sir Robert enters while reading Lady Chiltern's letter, but as the letter does not have the name of the addressee, he assumes it is meant for him, and reads it as a letter of forgiveness.
An Ideal Husband	40	44	The two reconcile.
An Ideal Husband	41	44	Lady Chiltern initially agrees to support Sir Robert's decision to renounce his career in politics, but Lord Goring dissuades her from allowing her husband to resign.
An Ideal Husband	42	44	When Sir Robert refuses Lord Goring his sister's hand in marriage, still believing he has taken up with mrs Cheveley, Lady Chiltern is forced to explain last night's events and the true nature of the letter.
An Ideal Husband	43	44	Sir Robert relents, and Lord Goring and Mabel are permitted to wed.

Mr. Destiny	0	38	The story begins on "the strangest day" of Larry Burrows' (James Belushi) life (his 35th birthday) consisting of a series of comic and dramatic misadventures.
Mr. Destiny	1	38	Larry, who blames all of his life's problems on the fact that he struck out during a key moment of his state high school baseball championship game on his 15th birthday, wishes he had done things differently.
Mr. Destiny	2	38	His wish is granted by a guardian angel-like figure named Mike (Michael Caine), and appears at various times as a bartender, a cab driver, and so on.
Mr. Destiny	3	38	Larry soon discovers that Mike has transferred Larry into an alternative reality in which he had won the pivotal high school game.
Mr. Destiny	4	38	He now finds himself rich and (within his company) powerful, and married to the boss's (Bill McCutcheon) sexy daughter Cindy Jo Bumpers (Rene Russo).
Mr. Destiny	5	38	At first, his new life seems perfect, but he soon begins to miss his best friend Clip Metzler (Jon Lovitz) and wife Ellen (Linda Hamilton) from his previous life; he also discovers that his alternative self has created many enemies, like Jewel Jagger (Courteney Cox), and as Larry's problems multiply, he finds himself wishing to be put back into his old life.
Mr. Destiny	6	38	The story begins with Larry's car, an old Ford LTD station wagon, stalled out in a dark alley.
Mr. Destiny	7	38	Suddenly the pink lights of "The Universal Joint," a bar, come on.
Mr. Destiny	8	38	Larry goes inside to call a tow truck, and tells bartender Mike his troubles.
Mr. Destiny	9	38	He reviews the day he just had, which ended with his getting fired after discovering his department head Niles Pender's (Hart Bochner) scheme to sell the company under the nose of its owners to a group of naive Japanese investors.
Mr. Destiny	10	38	He tells Mike that he wishes he'd hit that last pitch out of the park, after which Mike fixes him a drink called "The Spilt Milk".
Mr. Destiny	11	38	The Spilt Milk was a drink that gave him his wish that he hit that home run in that championship game.
Mr. Destiny	12	38	Larry leaves the bar, walks home (his car apparently towed) and discovers someone else living in his house, which is now fixed up (previously his yard and driveway were muddy and unfinished).
Mr. Destiny	13	38	Mike appears as a cab driver and drives him to his "new" home, a mansion in Forest Hills, explaining that he did in fact hit the last pitch and won the game.
Mr. Destiny	14	38	He soon discovers that Cindy Jo is his wife and he's the president of his company, Liberty Republic Sporting Goods.
Mr. Destiny	15	38	Being a classic car buff, he's shocked to find that he owns a collection of priceless antique automobiles.
Mr. Destiny	16	38	Larry soon discovers that Clip has a low-level job in the accounting department and is quite insecure, as opposed to the jokester he was before.
Mr. Destiny	17	38	Ellen is shop steward (in both realities) and is married to another man.
Mr. Destiny	18	38	Jewel, a forklift operator in the previous reality, is now Larry's mistress and his secretary.
Mr. Destiny	19	38	Ellen hates Larry and he discovers that the union is threatening a walkout due to massive layoffs and increased production, since Niles is selling Liberty Republic in both realities.
Mr. Destiny	20	38	Seeing Ellen, he realizes how much he misses her and agrees to all the union's demands, providing Ellen agrees to dinner at his favorite restaurant.
Mr. Destiny	21	38	She reluctantly agrees, and Larry eventually convinces her that they were married in a previous life.
Mr. Destiny	22	38	After discovering that Larry has agreed to union demands, Niles takes revenge, by telling both Cindy Jo and Jewel of Larry's dinner date with Ellen.
Mr. Destiny	23	38	He then plots to kill Larry at the office that night.
Mr. Destiny	24	38	However, company owner Leo Hansen arrives to deliver a note to Larry, announcing his termination, and Niles kills him by mistake.
Mr. Destiny	25	38	Discovering the note, Niles calls the police who attempt to arrest Larry for Leo's murder.
Mr. Destiny	26	38	Larry escapes while jealous Jewel creates pandemonium outside in her attempts to shoot him (and shoots out a number of police cars in the process), leading to a police chase.
Mr. Destiny	27	38	Larry is eventually cornered in a dark alley but the pink glow of "The Universal Joint" comes on and he runs into the bar.
Mr. Destiny	28	38	Unable to find Mike, Larry attempts to make the "Spilt Milk" himself, the ingredients clearly aged.
Mr. Destiny	29	38	The flashing lights of the police cars appear and Larry surrenders but instead of cops, a tow truck driver named Duncan enters (the police car lights now tow truck lights).
Mr. Destiny	30	38	Confused at first, Larry sees Mike back behind the bar and realizes he's back in his old life.
Mr. Destiny	31	38	Larry thanks Mike for everything and, upon exiting the bar, suddenly realizes that the deal with the Japanese investors is happening shortly.
Mr. Destiny	32	38	Driven by Duncan to company headquarters, Larry barges into the boardroom, decks Niles and exposes his scheme just as Leo is about to sign the deal.
Mr. Destiny	33	38	Thinking everyone forgot his birthday, Larry returns home (which still has the muddy driveway and lawn) to a surprise party with his family and friends in attendance.
Mr. Destiny	34	38	Soon after, Cindy Jo and her husband Jackie Earle (Jay Sanders), the company president arrive.
Mr. Destiny	35	38	Jackie offers Niles' job to Larry, plus a company car, a new Mercedes and he accepts.
Mr. Destiny	36	38	Back in the past, young Larry is about to leave the stadium, still upset about the loss, when he's approached by a mysterious stranger (Mike) who reassures him that everything will be alright.
Mr. Destiny	37	38	Larry thanks him for the reassurance, but walks off wondering who Mike thinks he's kidding.

Down with Love	0	35	In early 1960s New York City, Barbara Novak arrives in town at Banner House to present her new work, Down with Love, a book the intent of which is to free women from love, teach them to enjoy sex without commitment, and to replace the need for a man with things such as chocolate.
Down with Love	1	35	Following her rules would, she believes, help to give women a boost in the workplace and in the world in general.
Down with Love	2	35	The men who run Banner House refuse to support the book.
Down with Love	3	35	The only way Vikki Hiller, Barbara's editor, can find to promote the book is for Barbara to meet Catcher Block – a successful writer for the magazine Know and a notorious "ladies' man, man's man, man about town" – but he avoids her repeatedly by postponing their dates until she gets fed up, insults him, and walks out.
Down with Love	4	35	Catcher's boss and best friend, Peter MacMannus, and Vikki take a liking to one another.
Down with Love	5	35	However, their relationship revolves around Barbara and Catcher, and neither is brave enough to express their feelings for the other.
Down with Love	6	35	Peter feels overshadowed by Catcher's strong personality, and Vikki wants to see emotional commitment in her lover.
Down with Love	7	35	She even assumes Peter must be gay due to his perceived lack of interest.
Down with Love	8	35	Barbara starts promoting her book with Vikki's help, and things take off when they get Judy Garland to sing the song "Down with Love" as a promotion to the book on The Ed Sullivan Show.
Down with Love	9	35	Sales skyrocket, as housewives and women around the world buy the book and rebel against their men; Catcher now wants to meet Barbara, but now it is she who rejects him.
Down with Love	10	35	It all comes to a boiling point when Barbara appears on a national TV show talking about a chapter from the book – "The Worst Kind of Man" – and cites Catcher Block as the perfect example.
Down with Love	11	35	Subsequently, Catcher's date rejects him, which infuriates him.
Down with Love	12	35	Catcher swears revenge on Barbara and to undo the damage (as he sees it) done by her book by writing the "exposé of the Century" - he will prove to the world that, deep down, all women are the same, they all want love and marriage.
Down with Love	13	35	Including Barbara Novak.
Down with Love	14	35	He arranges for a casual meeting at a dry cleaner shop, taking advantage of the fact that Barbara has never met or seen him, and he poses as an astronaut, Major Zip Martin, attentive and polite.

Down with Love	17	35	But he starts falling for her, and it gets harder to go through with his plan.
Down with Love	18	35	When Barbara finds Catcher/Zip at a party he is almost caught out, and decides it is time to take everything to the next level: he tells Barbara that Catcher Block wants to interview him for an exposé on the NASA space program and asks her to accompany him.
Down with Love	19	35	It is his own apartment, and he sets everything up to record her saying she loves him.
Down with Love	20	35	But then it is she who reveals the truth: she knew he was really Catcher from the beginning, but she also lied as she is not Barbara Novak but Nancy Brown, once one of Catcher's many secretaries, who fell in love with him while working at Know, but who turned him down when he asked her out because she did not want to be just another one in his long list of romances.
Down with Love	21	35	She tells him she did this to be different from all the women he knew, and make him love her.
Down with Love	22	35	They both realize that Catcher does love her, but as he is proposing, one of his many lovers appears and thanks Barbara for what she has done for womankind.
Down with Love	23	35	Barbara realizes that she does not want love or him as she has become a real "down with love" girl.
Down with Love	24	35	Vikki and Peter's relationship also changes when she insults him for helping Catcher.
Down with Love	25	35	Peter realizes he is indeed like any other man and takes Vikki to Catcher's apartment to take things to the next level.
Down with Love	26	35	Days later, Catcher is completely depressed; all his efforts to win Barbara back have failed.
Down with Love	27	35	Even his exposé is ruined now that Barbara has told her story in her own magazine, Now.
Down with Love	28	35	Peter is also depressed as his relationship with Vikki is now apparently based only on sex.
Down with Love	29	35	Catcher realizes he can do something and writes a new exposé "How Falling In Love With Barbara Novak Made Me A New Man".
Down with Love	30	35	He learns there is an opening at Now and goes for an interview with her.
Down with Love	31	35	There, he tells her how much she changed him, and it is obvious she wants him but turns him down anyway; he says he wished there could be a middle ground for them "somewhere between a blonde and a brunette", referring to her real persona, where she was a brunette.
Down with Love	32	35	As he is leaving her office, he realizes she is not coming after him, but she surprises him on the elevator, showing him a bright red hair style: she has found the middle ground and she wants to be with him.
Down with Love	33	35	They fly to Vegas to get married, influencing Vikki and Peter, who also decide to get married.
Down with Love	34	35	Their marriage results in a new book intended to end the battle of the sexes, with the pair ultimately singing "Here's To Love".

Million Dollar Baby	29	33	Just before administering a fatal injection of adrenaline, he finally tells Maggie the meaning of a nickname he gave her, Mo Chuisle (spelled incorrectly in the film as "mo cuishle"): Irish for "my darling, and my blood" (literally, "my pulse").
Million Dollar Baby	30	33	He never returns to the gym.

100 Girls	1	44	Matthew and this unknown woman have sex in the dark.
100 Girls	2	44	When Matthew wakes up in the morning—still in the elevator—he finds himself alone with a pair of her panties.
100 Girls	3	44	On a mission to find his mystery maiden by finding a matching bra for the panties, Matthew becomes the maintenance man of the virgin vault.
100 Girls	4	44	After releasing mice, he goes room to room, setting traps.
100 Girls	5	44	He convinces the panicked women to leave their rooms and then starts to look for a match.
100 Girls	6	44	When he is unsuccessful, he continues to break things (such as the air conditioning) in an effort to find his woman.
100 Girls	7	44	He also fixes the television set, which is greatly received by women he refers to as "Jane-ites", as they have a great interest in films adapted from books by Jane Austen.
100 Girls	8	44	He doesn't get much help from his roommate Rod (James DeBello), who keeps telling him to give up, and together they philosophize about men and women.
100 Girls	9	44	Rod tells him that he doesn't need a girlfriend and that it's futile to try to find the "bra matching the panties", and Matthew accuses him of being too macho.
100 Girls	10	44	Rod introduces Matthew to the "penile power", which involves the use of weights attached to his penis as a means of increasing the organ's size.
100 Girls	11	44	He does this and insults women to make himself feel better about the problem he has with his manhood; he suffers from hypospadias.
100 Girls	12	44	Early on, Matthew watches as a woman named Patty (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and her boyfriend Crick (Johnny Green) fight.
100 Girls	13	44	Crick is the epitome of the macho man stereotype, with his big pectorals, conceited attitude, and abusiveness.
100 Girls	14	44	He wears a ponytail, a manicured goatee, "male make-up", and chews nicotine gum, much to Matthew's dismay.
100 Girls	15	44	Matthew tries to save Patty, but is hurt by Crick.

100 Girls	20	44	Matthew is nervous about talking to girls.

100 Girls	23	44	ms Stern asserts that women, rather than men, should be in command.
100 Girls	24	44	Rod tells Matthew that he's a chicken and should just give up on girls, while Matthew tells him that he has never been able to speak to girls, especially Cynthia (Jaime Pressly).
100 Girls	25	44	Matthew puts an advertisement in the school newspaper asking the girl he's seeking to meet him in the basement on a Thursday night.
100 Girls	26	44	He sits in the dark every Thursday night, waiting for her to show up.
100 Girls	27	44	The door opens one night, and he thinks it's her, but it's Wendy, coming to check up on him.
100 Girls	28	44	Finally, the mystery maiden does show up, only to tell him to stop looking for her.
100 Girls	29	44	Despite the approach of the end of the semester, Matthew isn't deterred.
100 Girls	30	44	He disguises himself in drag, as Francesca, as a means to continue his search.
100 Girls	31	44	In drag, he is actually able to talk to Cynthia one on one which, (until she is injured later on), he is not able to do because he is intimidated by her good looks.
100 Girls	32	44	Rod flirts with Francesca and later brags to Matthew that he had sex with Francesca.
100 Girls	33	44	This makes Matthew so angry that he adds another weight onto Rod's "penile power" device, hurting him.
100 Girls	34	44	Crick makes a pass at Matthew in drag while he fights with Patty.
100 Girls	35	44	Matthew bites off part of Crick's tongue.
100 Girls	36	44	As a result, Crick is unable to speak without lisping.
100 Girls	37	44	Desperation sets in, so Matthew appeals to his mystery maiden by proclaiming his love for her to the whole dormitory.
100 Girls	38	44	He finally determines his mystery maiden is Patty.
100 Girls	39	44	She initially rejects him because she thought that he would see her only as a slut.
100 Girls	40	44	Crick sees that Matthew wants Patty, but Matthew has him arrested for sexually assaulting him (when he was dressed as Francesca).
100 Girls	41	44	Matthew introduces Rod and Dora, and Arlene and Wendy hook up.
100 Girls	42	44	Cynthia shows off her newly found martial art abilities, and ms Stern learns a valuable lesson on gender equality, as Matthew stands up to her in front of the class, to an ovation.
100 Girls	43	44	Finally, Matthew proclaims his passionate love to Patty, who sees his loving eyes, and they kiss.

She's Gotta Have It	0	16	Nola Darling (Tracy Camilla Johns) is a young, attractive, sexually independent Brooklynite who juggles three suitors: the polite and well-meaning Jamie Overstreet (Tommy Redmond Hicks); the self-obsessed model Greer Childs (John Canada Terrell); and the immature, motor-mouthed Mars Blackmon (Spike Lee).
She's Gotta Have It	1	16	Nola is attracted to the best in each of them, but refuses to commit to any of them, cherishing her personal freedom instead, while each man wants her for himself.
She's Gotta Have It	2	16	Her carefree sexually liberated lifestyle ultimately comes to an end when her three male suitors meet and compare notes on Nola.
She's Gotta Have It	3	16	While Greer justifies Nola's callous behavior by claiming that she sees the three not as individuals but as a collective, Jamie and Mars become bitter over how little Nola cares for all three men.
She's Gotta Have It	4	16	Realizing that Mars and Greer are too scared of losing Nola to force her to choose one of the three men, Jamie lays down an ultimatum to her that she must choose a single lover.
She's Gotta Have It	5	16	Nola scoffs at this decision, and visits him several days later at his apartment for casual sex.

She's Gotta Have It	7	16	Being raped causes Nola to have an epiphany: realizing that promiscuity has turned Jamie against her, she decides to call Jamie's bluff.
She's Gotta Have It	8	16	Nola dumps Greer and Mars and then tells Jamie that she's is ready for a monogamous relationship.
She's Gotta Have It	9	16	However, there is a catch: Nola, believing that her promiscuity is the source of her inability to commit to a single guy, wants the relationship to be celibate for the time being.
She's Gotta Have It	10	16	Though he at first rejects Nola's "no sex" decree, Jamie agrees to it after initially saying no.
She's Gotta Have It	11	16	Nola and Jamie's reunion however, is followed by a coda which dismantles the "happy ending" of the couple coming together.
She's Gotta Have It	12	16	In a monologue delivered to the camera Nola reveals that her vow of celibacy and her decision to be with Jamie exclusively was "a moment of weakness".
She's Gotta Have It	13	16	Nola explains that she soon began to cheat on Jamie and ultimately the relationship collapsed, though she is vague on specifics or whether or not she resumed her casual affairs with Mars or Greer (the latter of which vowed never to have anything else to do with Nola after being dumped).
She's Gotta Have It	14	16	Nola proudly proclaims that monogamy was a form of slavery and that her promiscuous lifestyle is freedom in its purest form.
She's Gotta Have It	15	16	However, the film implies that Nola is still terminally unhappy with her decision to leave Jamie as the film closes with Nola going to bed all alone.
My Sassy Girl	0	47	The film tells the love story of a male engineering college student, Gyeon-woo, and "the Girl" (who is never named in the movie).
My Sassy Girl	1	47	Gyeon-woo just cannot seem to catch a romantic break.

My Sassy Girl	3	47	At the train station on his way to his aunt's, he observes a drunk girl, standing precariously close to the edge of the train platform as the train approaches; he pulls her to safety just in time.
My Sassy Girl	4	47	Inside the train, Gyeon-woo cannot help but stare at the girl who is his "type" but repulsed by her drunkenness.
My Sassy Girl	5	47	Finally, she throws up on a passenger and faints but not before she calls Gyeon-woo "honey".
My Sassy Girl	6	47	The passenger aggressively chides Gyeon-woo and tells him to take care of his "girlfriend".
My Sassy Girl	7	47	Gyeon-woo, completely flustered, carries her all the way to the nearest hotel.
My Sassy Girl	8	47	Thus begins his comically ill-fated relationship with the Girl.
My Sassy Girl	9	47	They meet each other again after Gyeon-woo gets locked up in jail over a misunderstanding, and over soju the Girl cries, admits to breaking up with her boyfriend the day before and gets thoroughly drunk, resulting in a second trip to the same hotel.
My Sassy Girl	10	47	After this second overnight stay at the hotel, she begins to become a more active part of his life.
My Sassy Girl	11	47	She visits Gyeon-woo in school and pulls him out of class, telling the teacher that Gyeon-woo is the father of her soon-to-be-aborted baby.
My Sassy Girl	12	47	The Girl's mood swings wildly from joyful to downright violent, but Gyeon-woo puts up with it and lets her abuse him for her amusement.
My Sassy Girl	13	47	She is an aspiring scriptwriter and throughout the movie gives Gyeon-woo three different screenplays from different genres.
My Sassy Girl	14	47	The first is an action movie—The Demolition Terminator—which switches gender roles, symbolically having the Girl save her helpless lover (Gyeon-woo).
My Sassy Girl	15	47	The second is a wild perversion of a Korean short story—Sonagi—in which the Girl, having died, asks that her lover be buried along with her—even though he's still alive.
My Sassy Girl	16	47	The last is a wuxia/samurai movie spoof full of genre clichés and anachronisms.
My Sassy Girl	17	47	All three feature the same common thread: the Girl is from the future.
My Sassy Girl	18	47	Despite all the horrible things Gyeon-woo endures, he is determined to help cure the girl's pain.
My Sassy Girl	19	47	He decides to surprise her on her birthday and takes her on a nighttime trip to an amusement park which ends up quite differently from how he planned: the pair encounter an AWOL soldier who holds them hostage and rants about his misery after being jilted.
My Sassy Girl	20	47	Gyeon-woo convinces him to release her, and she in turn convinces the soldier to free Gyeon-woo and go on with his life and pursue another love.
My Sassy Girl	21	47	The Girl and Gyeon-woo's relationship takes a turn for the better and he sends her home and meets her father, who is a habitual drinker.
My Sassy Girl	22	47	Her parents do not take to Gyeon-woo and on leaving, he overhears an impassioned argument between the girl and her mother over her relationship with him.
My Sassy Girl	23	47	He does not hear from her for quite some time and his life without her begins.
My Sassy Girl	24	47	One day however, the Girl calls him and tells him to bring her a rose during class to commemorate their 100th-day anniversary.
My Sassy Girl	25	47	He does this, leading to a touching and romantic scene where he arrives in disguise into a packed auditorium and watches her play the melody of George Winston's variations on Pachelbel's Canon in D on a piano onstage.
My Sassy Girl	26	47	The classmates applaud in approval at his romantic gesture.
My Sassy Girl	27	47	As the night unfolds he is confronted at her house by her parents again, with her father demanding the two to break up.
My Sassy Girl	28	47	The Girl does not contact him again and Gyeon-woo naturally thinks they have broken up, until one day when she calls Gyeon-woo to meet her for dinner with a blind date.
My Sassy Girl	29	47	The Girl introduces Gyeon-woo to the date and, while she leaves for the washroom afterwards, Gyeon-woo candidly offers advice on how to ensure her happiness by asking her potential suitor to follow ten rules: preventing her from overdrinking and giving in to her at every circumstance, even if it means enduring the occasional "violence".
My Sassy Girl	30	47	It is at this point that she realizes how well Gyeon-woo understands her.
My Sassy Girl	31	47	She abruptly leaves her date and searches for Gyeon-woo at the subway station.
My Sassy Girl	32	47	Once reunited the two realize they are at a turning point in their relationship, but, for some unspeakable reason, the Girl decides it is time for them to part.
My Sassy Girl	33	47	As a gesture to their happy times the two write letters to each other and bury them in a "time capsule" under a particular tree on a mountain in the countryside.
My Sassy Girl	34	47	They agree to meet again at the tree after two years to read the letters together.
My Sassy Girl	35	47	After burying the "time capsule" they go their separate ways.
My Sassy Girl	36	47	During the two-year span, Gyeon-woo works hard to improve himself, writing My Sassy Girl movie script after he details their love affair on the Internet.
My Sassy Girl	37	47	When the agreed upon date arrives, he travels to the mountain but the Girl does not show up.
My Sassy Girl	38	47	Eventually, he opens the time capsule and reads her letter and learns the root of her angst and behavior: Gyeon-woo reminds her of her previous boyfriend who, rather than breaking up with her, actually died before she met Gyeon-woo.
My Sassy Girl	39	47	All through the time the Girl and Gyeon-woo were seeing each other she had been seeing her dead boyfriend's mother, who wants to introduce her to a nice young man.
My Sassy Girl	40	47	A year after Gyeon-woo visits the tree, the Girl finally arrives.
My Sassy Girl	41	47	Sitting under the tree is an old man.
My Sassy Girl	42	47	During their conversation the old man reveals the secret of the tree, that it is not the same tree; the original tree had been struck and killed by lightning a year before and a similar tree had been planted by a young man so that his special someone would not be sad.
My Sassy Girl	43	47	After the girl reads his letter, she tries to call Gyeon-woo repeatedly, but is unable to contact him.
My Sassy Girl	44	47	At lunch with her deceased boyfriend's mother after a year later, the mother introduces her nephew—who turns out to be Gyeon-woo, whom she has been trying to introduce to the Girl for years.
My Sassy Girl	45	47	The mother, who is Gyeon-woo's aunt, tells the Girl to go out with him, hoping that he could make life easier for her.
My Sassy Girl	46	47	She tells Gyeon-woo that the Girl can give advice to him about his impending trip to England, to which he replies, "I don't have to go anymore".

Kissing Jessica Stein	1	28	The advertisement has been placed by Helen Cooper, a thirtysomething bisexual art gallerist who is seeking a lesbian relationship to replace her unsatisfying and meaningless sex with men.
Kissing Jessica Stein	2	28	Given some of the men Jessica is shown to be test-dating at the start of the film, it's no surprise she'd want to fan out her prospects a little.

Kissing Jessica Stein	10	28	In spite of Jessica's happiness with Helen, she keeps the relationship secret.

Kissing Jessica Stein	18	28	Her mother says that she worries about Jessica having this attitude towards life, and that sometimes she thinks back to that night and thinks that if Jessica went on, maybe it wouldn't have been the best, but it might have been pretty good&mdash;and who knows, maybe it would have been the best ever.
Kissing Jessica Stein	19	28	She then tells Jessica that she thinks Helen "is a very nice girl".

Kissing Jessica Stein	23	28	Jessica rejects him, explaining that she already has Helen.
Kissing Jessica Stein	24	28	Jessica and Helen move in together, but their relationship, while good in most respects, begins to suffer from a lack of frequent sexual intimacy.

Kissing Jessica Stein	26	28	The relationship ends amidst Jessica's tears and Helen's realization that she wants more than Jessica is willing to offer.
Kissing Jessica Stein	27	28	After moving beyond the heartbreak, Jessica and Helen appear to remain friends, and it is suggested that Jessica might now have a renewed interest in Josh, after both have left the newspaper where they previously worked.

Monster-in-Law	2	28	But then Kevin asks her out, and Charlie believes that she's finally found the right man.
Monster-in-Law	3	28	Things start to go wrong when Kevin introduces Charlie to his mother, Viola Fields (Jane Fonda).

Monster-in-Law	11	28	Suddenly, Viola's own dreadful mother-in-law, Kevin's grandmother, Gertrude Fields (Elaine Stritch), appears and they have an indignant argument, while Gertrude takes a liking to Charlie, saying she is stunning, her grandson is a lucky man, that she is an "exotic Latina", and if only her son, Kevin's father, was as lucky to find a woman like Charlie.
Monster-in-Law	12	28	Gertrude's resentment of Viola bears a strong resemblance to Viola's feelings of animosity toward Charlie.

Monster-in-Law	16	28	Charlie decides to back down as she witnesses Gertrude and Viola's relationship.

Monster-in-Law	20	28	Viola is miffed that Charlie compared her to Gertrude, although Ruby points out that Viola is actually far worse than Gertrude, as she doesn't ever recall Gertrude trying to poison Viola once, referring to earlier at the rehearsal dinner when Viola put crushed nuts (which Charlie is highly allergic to) in the meal's gravy.
Monster-in-Law	21	28	Ruby points out that Viola's efforts against Charlie to make Kevin happy are unwarranted.
Monster-in-Law	22	28	"Whatever made you think he wasn't.
Monster-in-Law	23	28	" is her final point.
Monster-in-Law	24	28	Viola has an epiphany and realizes that she wants Charlie to stay, and they reconcile, which ends the feud.
Monster-in-Law	25	28	Charlie then explains to Viola that she wants her to stay, too, on one condition: if Viola accepts the boundaries Charlie needs, if she is present at any family event, and if she treats her children with love.
Monster-in-Law	26	28	Charlie and Kevin then get married and when Charlie throws her wedding bouquet, Viola catches the flowers.
Monster-in-Law	27	28	As Charlie and Kevin drive away to their honeymoon, the film ends as Viola and Ruby walk out of the celebration.

Hatari!	0	57	Hatari.
Hatari!	1	57	is the story of a group of adventurers in East Africa, engaged in the exciting and lucrative but dangerous business of catching wild animals for delivery to zoos around the world.
Hatari!	2	57	As "Momella Game Ltd".
Hatari!	3	57	, they operate from a compound near the town of Arusha.
Hatari!	4	57	The head of the group is Sean Mercer (John Wayne); the others are safari veteran Little Wolf a/k/a "the Indian" (Bruce Cabot); drivers "Pockets" (Red Buttons), a former Brooklyn taxi driver, and Kurt (Hardy Krüger), a German auto racing driver; roper Luis (Valentin de Vargas), a former Mexican bullfighter, and Brandy (Michele Girardon), a young woman whose late father was a member of the group; she grew up there and owns the business.
Hatari!	5	57	Their method (shown in several action sequences) is to chase the selected animal across the plains with a truck, driven by Pockets.
Hatari!	6	57	Sean stands in the bed of the truck with a rope noose on a long pole, and snags the animal by its head.
Hatari!	7	57	(For smaller animals, Sean rides in a seat mounted on the truck's left front fender) A smaller, faster "herding car," driven by Kurt, swings outside, driving the animal back toward the "catching truck".
Hatari!	8	57	Once the animal is snagged, Luis, an expert roper, catches its legs and secures it.
Hatari!	9	57	The animal is then moved into a travel crate and carried on a third truck, driven by Brandy.
Hatari!	10	57	The captured animals are held in pens in the compound, tended by native workers, until they are shipped out at the end of the hunting season.
Hatari!	11	57	In the opening sequence, the team chases a rhinoceros, but it attacks the herding car and severely gores the Indian, who has to be transported to the Arusha hospital.
Hatari!	12	57	While they are waiting to hear about the Indian's condition, a young Frenchman (Gerard Blain) approaches Sean about taking the Indian's job.
Hatari!	13	57	This offends Kurt, who knocks the Frenchman down.
Hatari!	14	57	Then dr Sanderson (Eduard Franz) says the Indian may die without a transfusion of rare type AB Negative blood.
Hatari!	15	57	However, the Frenchman has that blood type.
Hatari!	16	57	He agrees to donate his blood for the transfusion.
Hatari!	17	57	The group returns to the compound after celebrating the Indian's survival.
Hatari!	18	57	Sean is surprised to find a strange woman sleeping in his bed.
Hatari!	19	57	The next morning, she introduces herself as Anna Maria D'Alessandro ("Just call me Dallas") (Elsa Martinelli), a photojournalist sent by the Basel Zoo to record the capture of the animals they have ordered.
Hatari!	20	57	Sean is annoyed, but under the contract with the zoo they must accommodate her.
Hatari!	21	57	Dallas quickly makes friends with the others, especially Pockets.
Hatari!	22	57	She rides along on the group's catching runs, snapping pictures.
Hatari!	23	57	Dallas is immediately attracted to Sean, and (she thinks) he to her, but he treats her brusquely.
Hatari!	24	57	Pockets explains that a few years earlier, Sean was engaged to a woman who came to the compound, hated Sean's life there, and abruptly left him.
Hatari!	25	57	Ever since, he distrusts women, especially those to whom he is attracted.
Hatari!	26	57	The young Frenchman comes to the compound and, after proving himself a crack shot, is hired to replace the Indian for the rest of the catching season.
Hatari!	27	57	His name is Charles Maurey, but Sean dubs him "Chips".
Hatari!	28	57	His job is to ride with Kurt in the herding car, carrying a rifle in case an animal attacks.
Hatari!	29	57	The Indian returns, and urges Sean to forego catching any rhinos this season.
Hatari!	30	57	A "nice Belgian kid" was killed in an earlier rhino chase, as was Brandy's father; now the Indian was nearly killed.
Hatari!	31	57	He suggests there is a jinx.
Hatari!	32	57	Sean agrees only to postpone rhino to the end of the season.
Hatari!	33	57	Dallas makes some progress with Sean, but friction between them continues, especially after Dallas adopts first one, then two, and finally three orphaned elephant calves.
Hatari!	34	57	This leads to her adoption into the local Warusha tribe as "Mama Tembo" ("Mother of Elephants").
Hatari!	35	57	Chips and Kurt flirt with Brandy, but as things turn out, it is Pockets Brandy falls for.
Hatari!	36	57	This becomes clear to everyone on a day when the herding car flips over, dislocating Kurt's shoulder and cutting Chips up.
Hatari!	37	57	Brandy doesn't react much to their injuries, but when Pockets falls off a fence and wrenches his back, she is nearly hysterical with worry over his "injury".
Hatari!	38	57	Animal chases continue, with the group capturing a zebra, a giraffe, a gazelle, a buffalo, and a wildebeest.
Hatari!	39	57	They also trap a leopard in a baited cage.
Hatari!	40	57	When the herding car is mired during a river crossing, Chips shoots a crocodile that is threatening Kurt, and a strong friendship develops between them.
Hatari!	41	57	Pockets spends several days privately tinkering in the compound workshop.
Hatari!	42	57	He invents a method of flinging a net over a tree full of monkeys, which the zoos want.
Hatari!	43	57	His rocket-net is a success, catching over 500 of them.
Hatari!	44	57	With all other orders filled, the group catches a rhino without serious incident, and the Indian agrees that the jinx is broken.
Hatari!	45	57	The group goes to Arusha to celebrate the end of the season, but Dallas declines.
Hatari!	46	57	She is frustrated, because though she has had some intimate moments with Sean, he has never clearly declared how he feels about her.
Hatari!	47	57	When Sean urges her to join the group's excursion, she lashes out at him and bursts into tears, leaving him baffled.
Hatari!	48	57	The next morning, Dallas has vanished, leaving a farewell letter with Pockets.
Hatari!	49	57	Sean and the group rush to Arusha to catch her.
Hatari!	50	57	To help locate Dallas they take along one of the baby elephants, to track her by scent.
Hatari!	51	57	Not wanting to be left behind, the other two follow the truck to Arusha.
Hatari!	52	57	The ensuing chase ends when the elephants corner Dallas in a hotel lobby.
Hatari!	53	57	In the final scene, Dallas is again in Sean's bed when he enters the room, and they reprise the dialogue from their first meeting.
Hatari!	54	57	As before, Pockets also comes in drunk and again asks Sean "What is she doing in your bed.
Hatari!	55	57	" But this time, Sean announces "We got married today.
Hatari!	56	57	" After Sean herds Pockets out of their room, Tembo and his two brothers push their way in and break Sean's bed as the newlyweds try to figure out how to deal with them.

Keeping the Faith	3	35	Rabbi Jacob "Jake" Schram (Ben Stiller), best friends with Brian since childhood, is the youngest rabbi at his Conservative synagogue; his lack of effort to find a Jewish wife often results in his mother, Ruth (Anne Bancroft) and other women of his congregation setting him up on blind dates, much to his dismay.
Keeping the Faith	4	35	The two men show a close bond, even in their professions, where the two are planning the opening of a jointly sponsored community center.
Keeping the Faith	5	35	In its earlier days, the friendship included a third party.
Keeping the Faith	6	35	Via flashbacks and reminiscent musings, Anna Reilly (Jenna Elfman) is introduced: she met Jake and Brian in middle school, after beating up a bully who was picking on them.
Keeping the Faith	7	35	The three became great friends, and enjoyed their childhood together.
Keeping the Faith	8	35	Unfortunately, Anna's father got a new job that resulted in the Reillys moving to California, and ultimately she lost touch with Brian and Jake.
Keeping the Faith	9	35	Sixteen years later, Anna calls her old friends out of the blue and the friendship is rekindled when her company temporarily reassigns her to a New York position.
Keeping the Faith	10	35	Feelings quickly begin to run deeper than before, as Anna, despite her workaholic tendencies, is as vibrant as Brian and Jake remembered her; however, it is, ironically, the men's careers that prove to be the most problematic.
Keeping the Faith	11	35	She and Jake begin sleeping together, but he is reluctant to be involved in a serious relationship with her because she is not Jewish, a fact which could compromise his relationship with his congregation and also with his mother (who disowned her eldest son - Jake's older brother Ethan - for marrying outside the faith).
Keeping the Faith	12	35	Between the religious conflict and their desire to spare the feelings of their mutual friend, the relationship is kept mostly secret, resulting in both humorous and harmful complications.
Keeping the Faith	13	35	As the months pass, both Jake and Anna's feelings for each other become stronger but due to the aforementioned issues, Jake still refuses the relationship as a serious one, despite Anna dropping hints to him about her having been recently taking a class (but refusing to tell him what kind of class it is), and her becoming visibly upset when they run into members of Jake's congregation while on a date and Jake introducing her only as "my old friend Anna".
Keeping the Faith	14	35	Meanwhile, Brian is involved in his own test of faith as he struggles with his feelings for Anna despite his vows.
Keeping the Faith	15	35	Apart from praying about the situation and discussing it with Fr.
Keeping the Faith	16	35	Havel, he keeps these thoughts mostly to himself.
Keeping the Faith	17	35	Brian begins misinterpreting Anna's words and actions (some of which are subtle signals to Jake as their affair is kept under wraps) and even has an erotic dream about her; he begins to seriously consider quitting the priesthood to pursue a romantic relationship with her.
Keeping the Faith	18	35	Anna tells Jake that she wants things to be more serious between them and he does not respond well.
Keeping the Faith	19	35	While the three have dinner one night with Jake's mother Ruth, Ruth has a private conversation with Anna, where she tearfully reveals that she knows about Anna and Jake's secret relationship.
Keeping the Faith	20	35	Jake and Brian walk in on the ladies having a tearful moment, and later Jake and Anna have an argument over the religious issues complicating their romance, which ends in the two parting ways in frustration.
Keeping the Faith	21	35	Anna calls Brian for comfort and he rushes over to her apartment.
Keeping the Faith	22	35	Still unaware of what's been going on, he takes her tearful ramblings to be a confession of feelings for him, then kisses her and admits his love.
Keeping the Faith	23	35	When she interrupts him, he first assumes it to be guilt based on his vows, but she tells him she is in love with Jake and finally admits that she and Jake have been seeing each other secretly for months.
Keeping the Faith	24	35	Feeling embarrassed and rejected, Brian raids Anna's liquor cabinet, angrily cutting off her attempts to re-assure him and apologize.
Keeping the Faith	25	35	He leaves and spends the whole night out drinking on the streets.
Keeping the Faith	26	35	The next day, still drunk, Brian stumbles into Jake's temple and interrupts a post-bar mitzvah gathering, resulting in a confrontation with Jake that ends with the priest punching the rabbi.
Keeping the Faith	27	35	He leaves and stumbles around the city, which brings the movie back to the very first scene with the bartender.
Keeping the Faith	28	35	As the Community Center's grand opening approaches, along with the last days of Anna's East Coast assignment, the relationships begin to mend, first with Jake reconciling with Brian, followed by Anna reconciling with Brian shortly after.
Keeping the Faith	29	35	A discussion between the two men prompts Jake to go to Anna's office building, with Brian shouting encouragement at him as he runs down the street.
Keeping the Faith	30	35	Jake interrupts Anna's going away office party and manages to get her attention from a window in the building across the street and calls to explain himself and offer to set things right.
Keeping the Faith	31	35	Later that evening, they surprise Brian in the middle of his karaoke number at the interfaith center, which looks to be off to a successful start.
Keeping the Faith	32	35	Anna greets Rabbi Lewis (Eli Wallach) as he passes by and asks about their meetings together, referencing the class that Anna had told Jake briefly she had been taking, at which point it becomes clear that she had been taking classes to convert to Judaism.
Keeping the Faith	33	35	She tells him she hopes to pick it up again as she is also now staying in New York, with Jake clearly thrilled.
Keeping the Faith	34	35	The film ends happily with the three childhood friends posing for a photo together.

Summer Lovers	7	42	He then feels so guilty that Cathy immediately notices something is wrong, and he admits what he has done, insisting that he still loves Cathy.
Summer Lovers	8	42	Cathy is naturally disturbed by this, but tells him to get it out of his system, which he takes as permission to return to Lina.
Summer Lovers	9	42	Cathy then goes to a local bar intending to sleep with another man as a way to get revenge against Michael for cheating on her.
Summer Lovers	10	42	But in the end she chickens out after getting picked up by an amorous local boy.

Summer Lovers	23	42	Lina moves in with them, and they continue enjoying the island paradise as a threesome.
Summer Lovers	24	42	Just as the fantasy seems to be a total success, the natural complications of domestic life, like who does the laundry or dishes, come to the foreground.
Summer Lovers	25	42	The three work through these problems, but then Cathy's mother (Barbara Rush) appears on a surprise visit, snapping everyone back to reality.
Summer Lovers	26	42	Cathy tells her mother she's never been happier in her life.
Summer Lovers	27	42	Although Lina claims to be bad at relationships and prefers just "screwing", the three actually seem to be falling in love all around.
Summer Lovers	28	42	Aside from Lina's comment that she prefers just "screwing," the sexually charged plot is underscored by a number of other instances of openly sexual comments and humor.

Summer Lovers	38	42	They pack up to return home, even though they have three weeks remaining prepaid on their rental.

Other People's Money	11	23	Garfield concedes to Jorgy's offer to let the matter be settled at the annual shareholder's meeting.
Other People's Money	12	23	Relying on the support of longtime friends and investors, Jorgy makes an impassioned plea to save the company, appealing to the traditions of manufacturing as opposed to the new breed of capitalism which Larry the Liquidator represents, in which buyers of companies create no products or jobs and are interested only in money.
Other People's Money	13	23	The shareholders seem swayed by Jorgy's speech and boo Garfield when he gets up to give a rebuttal.
Other People's Money	14	23	In his rebuttal, Garfield compares New England Wire & Cable to the last buggy whip manufacturer, arguing that even though the company's product may be high quality, changing technology has rendered it obsolete.
Other People's Money	15	23	Rather than running a failing business into the ground, he contends that the shareholders should follow his lead and get what value they can from the stock before the company's inevitable demise.
Other People's Money	16	23	At least when this company is liquidated, he says, they'll end up with a few dollars in their pocket.
Other People's Money	17	23	When the vote is taken, the shareholders agree to give Garfield controlling interest in the company.
Other People's Money	18	23	The margin of victory is greater than Coles' shares and thus he does not receive the full amount he betrayed Jorgy to get.
Other People's Money	19	23	Back at home in Manhattan, Garfield finds himself uncharacteristically despondent after his victory, having realized he has lost his chance for a romance with Kate.
Other People's Money	20	23	Just then, Kate calls.

The First Wives Club	5	25	She later walks outside of the balcony of her penthouse in a floor length fur coat, a cigarette and a drink, and then commits suicide by jumping to her death after learning through the tabloids that her ex-husband Gil (whom Cynthia made wealthy through her connections, according to narrator Annie) married his much younger mistress the day before.

The First Wives Club	17	25	When Annie starts thinking about closing down the First Wives Club, her friends come back, saying that they want to see this to the end and Bill hasn't done anything blatantly wrong, but only as far as he knows.

The First Wives Club	19	25	Deciding that revenge would make them no better than their husbands, they instead use these situations to push their men into funding the establishment of a nonprofit organization dedicated to aiding abused women, in memory of their college friend Cynthia.
The First Wives Club	20	25	The film ends with a celebration at the new Cynthia Swann Griffin Crisis Center for Women.
The First Wives Club	21	25	Annie narrates that Elise started a relationship with a cast member in her new, successful play, that Brenda and Morty reconciled their differences and got back together, and that when Aaron tried to get back together with her, Annie told him to "drop dead".

Solid Serenade	2	29	Tom brings along his string instrument (possibly a double bass or cello), then wakes up Spike and neutralizes him by whacking him in the head with a mallet and tying him up.
Solid Serenade	3	29	Tom uses his instrument as a pogo stick to hop over to the window, stopping halfway to taunt Spike along the way.
Solid Serenade	4	29	Tom plays "Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby"; the sound waves from the instrument shake Jerry's mousehole, bouncing Jerry off the bed, then under the table, and Jerry's head is hit by a vase that falls off the table when the mouse comes out the other side.
Solid Serenade	5	29	Having had enough, the mouse gets his revenge by going into the kitchen and hurling a pie with an iron stuffed inside; the cat is angered, but continues with a few more bars.
Solid Serenade	6	29	Seconds later, he is hit in the face again – this time with a pie covered in whipped cream.
Solid Serenade	7	29	Spotting Jerry, Tom chases him through the house.
Solid Serenade	8	29	Both animals dive off an ironing board; with Jerry ahead of Tom, Jerry drains the kitchen sink he landed in, leaving Tom to crash into the crockery.
Solid Serenade	9	29	Tom follows Jerry through the open window, but Jerry pulls the window stop out of the window.
Solid Serenade	10	29	The window falls on Tom's neck, and Tom shrieks in pain.
Solid Serenade	11	29	Jerry then runs out and unties Spike, and the dog lets out a loud bull roar, which starts a new chase.
Solid Serenade	12	29	Spike swaps his small teeth for "heavy-duty" ones, blows off some pent-up steam, and goes after Tom.
Solid Serenade	13	29	Tom ducks as Spike's teeth come at him, which instead get lodged in a tree trunk.
Solid Serenade	14	29	Tom then barely avoids getting his tail bitten and hides behind a wall, holding a brick up ready to attack.
Solid Serenade	15	29	Spike sees the brick and investigates, but gets knocked on the head with it.
Solid Serenade	16	29	With his ally eliminated, Jerry revives Spike by hitting him with a wooden plank.
Solid Serenade	17	29	After slamming Spike, Spike leaps high in the air screaming in pain just as Jerry hands off the board to Tom, framing the cat.
Solid Serenade	18	29	Knowing he is in trouble, Tom tricks Spike into believing the board is a bone by playing "fetch".
Solid Serenade	19	29	Spike obliges and fetches but realises he's been tricked.
Solid Serenade	20	29	Tom and Spike then begin a back and forth chase with Toodles Galore watching on.
Solid Serenade	21	29	Tom stops periodically to kiss the cat.
Solid Serenade	22	29	Catching on to this habit, Spike substitutes himself on the third pass, and gets wooed in a Charles Boyer voice (his lines recycled from The Zoot Cat).
Solid Serenade	23	29	Tom stops his speech abruptly when he sees the female cat and, realizing his mistake, drops Spike onto the floor.
Solid Serenade	24	29	Tom hides from Spike's rampage until Jerry walks around the corner; he chases Jerry to Spike's house, which Jerry immediately hides in.
Solid Serenade	25	29	Tom then sneaks into the doghouse with a murderous Dracula laugh while closing the door, indicating that something most foul is going to occur.
Solid Serenade	26	29	A second later, the door opens and Spike pokes his head out, helps Jerry out of his house and laughs even more evilly as he withdraws inside to.
Solid Serenade	27	29	The entire dog house thrashes about as Spike beats up Tom, who at one point quickly writes his will before being wrenched back in and beaten to within an inch of his life.
Solid Serenade	28	29	At the end, Toodles Galore watches Spike strum Tom, who had replaced the strings on his instrument, while Jerry plays a quick riff on Tom's whiskers.
Me and You and Everyone We Know	0	17	The structure of the film consists of several subplots which all revolve around an intertwined cast of characters.
Me and You and Everyone We Know	1	17	The film begins by introducing Richard (John Hawkes), a shoe salesman and recently separated father of two.
Me and You and Everyone We Know	2	17	After being thrown out by his wife Pam (JoNell Kennedy), he gets an apartment of his own to share with his children, Peter (Miles Thompson) and Robby (Brandon Ratcliff).
Me and You and Everyone We Know	3	17	He meets Christine (Miranda July), a senior-cab driver and amateur video artist, while she takes her client to shop for shoes, and the two develop a fledgling romantic relationship.
Me and You and Everyone We Know	4	17	Robby, six years old, and his 14-year-old brother, Peter, have a joint online chat which he later depicts in another chat session as "))<>((", an emoticon that means "pooping back and forth, forever".
Me and You and Everyone We Know	5	17	This piques the interest of the woman at the other end and she suggests a real life meeting.
Me and You and Everyone We Know	6	17	When Robby and the woman meet at a park, she realizes he's a child and kisses him and walks away.
Me and You and Everyone We Know	7	17	Two of Richard's teenaged neighbors, Heather (Natasha Slayton) and Rebecca (Najarra Townsend), develop a playful relationship with a much older neighbor Andrew (Brad William Henke) who works in the shoe store with Richard.
Me and You and Everyone We Know	8	17	He does not say much, but he keeps leaving signs on his window about what he would do to each of them.
Me and You and Everyone We Know	9	17	As a result of this relationship, Heather and Rebecca ask Peter if they can practice oral sex on him, so that he can tell them which of the two does it better; so they do.
Me and You and Everyone We Know	10	17	He says both were exactly the same.
Me and You and Everyone We Know	11	17	The daughter of a neighbor peeks in the window, sees what is happening, and quickly leaves.
Me and You and Everyone We Know	12	17	Heather and Rebecca later come to the neighbor's house intending to have sex with him as practice, but he appears afraid when he sees them through his window and he pretends not to be home.
Me and You and Everyone We Know	13	17	Meanwhile, Christine's work is rejected by a contemporary art museum, but then later accepted by the curator, who turns out to be the woman who was instant messaging with the brothers.
Me and You and Everyone We Know	14	17	The plots come together in the end, with Peter developing a friendship with the daughter of a neighbor, having been introduced to the hope chest that she has, Christine and Richard displaying a show of mutual acceptance of their attraction to each other, and, as a final plot device, Robby finding that the noise he had awoken to early every morning was that of an early-rising businessman tapping a quarter on a street sign pole.
Me and You and Everyone We Know	15	17	When asked why he is doing it, he stops and turns around, saying "just passing the time", and gives Robby the quarter.
Me and You and Everyone We Know	16	17	When his bus drives away and Robby tries it out himself, the sun heightens with each tap, time literally passing as he does it.

The Palm Beach Story	0	24	Tom and Gerry Jeffers (Joel McCrea and Claudette Colbert) are a married couple in New York City who are down on their luck financially, which is pushing the marriage to an end.
The Palm Beach Story	1	24	But there is a deeper problem with their relationship, just hinted at under the opening credits in the prologue, and only disclosed at the end.
The Palm Beach Story	2	24	In the prologue Claudette Colbert is bound and gagged in a closet, but a second later appears in a wedding dress.
The Palm Beach Story	3	24	This scene is cross-cut with groom Joel McCrea hurriedly changing from one formal suit to another while rushing to church for the wedding.
The Palm Beach Story	4	24	The last scenes finally reveal that both of the original fiancés have identical twins.
The Palm Beach Story	5	24	Both twins, trying to steal their sibling's intended, inadvertently married each other instead.
The Palm Beach Story	6	24	The couple remain married from 1937 until 1942, when this story begins.
The Palm Beach Story	7	24	Gerry decides that Tom would be better off if they split up.
The Palm Beach Story	8	24	She packs her bags; takes some money offered to her by the Wienie King (Robert Dudley), a strange but rich little man who is thinking of renting the Jeffers' apartment; and boards a train for Palm Beach, Florida.
The Palm Beach Story	9	24	There she plans to get a divorce and meet a wealthy second husband who can help Tom.
The Palm Beach Story	10	24	On the train, she meets the eccentric John Hackensacker III (Rudy Vallée), one of the richest men in the world.
The Palm Beach Story	11	24	Because of an encounter with the wild and drunken millionaire members of the Ale and Quail hunting club, Gerry loses all her luggage; after making do with clothing scrounged from other passengers, she is forced to accept Hackensacker's extravagant charity.
The Palm Beach Story	12	24	They leave the train and go on a shopping spree for everything from lingerie to jewelry – Hackensacker minutely noting the cost of everything in a little notebook, which he never bothers to add up – and make the remainder of the trip to Palm Beach on Hackensacker's yacht named The Erl King (a Sturges joke on the Hackensacker family business, oil).
The Palm Beach Story	13	24	Tom follows Gerry to Palm Beach by air, also with the impromptu financial assistance of the Wienie King.
The Palm Beach Story	14	24	When Tom meets Hackensacker, Gerry introduces him as her brother, Captain McGlue.
The Palm Beach Story	15	24	Soon, Hackensacker falls for Gerry, while his often-married, man-hungry sister, Princess Centimillia (Mary Astor), chases Tom, although her last lover, Toto (Sig Arno), is still following her around.
The Palm Beach Story	16	24	To help further his suit with Gerry, Hackensacker agrees to invest in Tom's scheme to build an airport suspended over a city by wires.
The Palm Beach Story	17	24	Tom finally persuades Gerry to give their marriage another chance, and they confess their masquerade to their disappointed suitors.
The Palm Beach Story	18	24	Even though he is disappointed, Hackensacker intends to go through with his investment in the suspended airport, since he thinks it is a good business deal and he never lets anything get in the way of business.
The Palm Beach Story	19	24	Then, when Tom and Gerry reveal that they met because they are both identical twins – a fact which explains the opening sequence of the film – Hackensacker and his sister are elated.
The Palm Beach Story	20	24	The final scene shows Hackensacker and Gerry's sister, and the Princess and Tom's brother, getting married.
The Palm Beach Story	21	24	The film ends where it began after the prologue, with the words "And they lived happily ever after.
The Palm Beach Story	22	24	or did they.
The Palm Beach Story	23	24	" on title cards.
It Should Happen to You	0	72	The script, by Garson Kanin, is about a naive young woman named Gladys Glover who yearns for fame.
It Should Happen to You	1	72	Strolling through Central Park, she meets a young handsome man named Pete Sheppard (Jack Lemmon).
It Should Happen to You	2	72	He is a maker of documentaries (apparently equipped only with a handheld 16mm camera).
It Should Happen to You	3	72	He is taking brief shots of people in the park.
It Should Happen to You	4	72	He films Gladys feeding pigeons and introduces himself.
It Should Happen to You	5	72	In a rapid piece of exposition, we learn Gladys has been in New York City for two years, coming from a job at a shoe factory in Binghamton, New York.
It Should Happen to You	6	72	She has just lost her job as a model of girdles, because her hip size is 3/4" larger than it should be, and still has the $1000, which she "saved up".
It Should Happen to You	7	72	Gladys is discouraged at having gotten nowhere in two years and she wants to make a name for herself.
It Should Happen to You	8	72	It is clear Pete is taken by Gladys.
It Should Happen to You	9	72	He gets her address by offering to drop her a postcard when the documentary is finished so she can see herself in it.
It Should Happen to You	10	72	"Really.
It Should Happen to You	11	72	" she says, "I'd give my right arm to see myself in the movies".
It Should Happen to You	12	72	"You don't need to give me your right arm," says Pete, "just give me your right address".
It Should Happen to You	13	72	Pete encourages Gladys to follow her dreams: "Where there's a will there's a way, and where there's a way there is a will".
It Should Happen to You	14	72	The two then part ways.
It Should Happen to You	15	72	Wandering despondently, Gladys' attention is caught by a large billboard overlooking Columbus Circle with the notice, "This space for rent.
It Should Happen to You	16	72	Choice location.
It Should Happen to You	17	72	Inquire Horace Pfeiffer Co, 383 Madison Avenue".
It Should Happen to You	18	72	She fantasizes about her name being on the billboard and gathering up the nerve she goes to 383 Madison Avenue to inquire about the billboard.
It Should Happen to You	19	72	Gladys asks for "Mr.
It Should Happen to You	20	72	Horace Puh-feiffer," pronouncing the letter P, and is corrected by the receptionist who tells her there is no mr Pfeiffer.
It Should Happen to You	21	72	Determined, Gladys obtains an interview with a busy man conducting a telephone conversation, who brusquely tells her the sign is available, demands to know "whom she represents," and says "I'm really too busy for this sort of thing".
It Should Happen to You	22	72	The spunky Gladys pulls $1000 in cash from her purse, complains that the man is too "stuck up" to listen to her, asks "What sort of place treats people that way" and starts to leave.
It Should Happen to You	23	72	The representative relents and tells her the sign is $210 per month, three months minimum.
It Should Happen to You	24	72	Gladys pays $630 in cash and arranges to have her name put on the billboard.
It Should Happen to You	25	72	Within a few days the sign is up and she is thrilled.
It Should Happen to You	26	72	However, it turns out the Adams Soap company has traditionally booked the sign and is upset to learn that another client has obtained it.
It Should Happen to You	27	72	The Pfeiffer company calls Gladys to a meeting where Evan Adams III (Lawford) attempts to induce her to give up the sign by offering her more money.
It Should Happen to You	28	72	Gladys is not interested.
It Should Happen to You	29	72	She is called to another meeting and is offered six signs in exchange for the one.
It Should Happen to You	30	72	This time, she accepts.
It Should Happen to You	31	72	Now, there are six huge signs in New York, one in lights, each saying simply "Gladys Glover".
It Should Happen to You	32	72	Meanwhile, Pete Sheppard has taken an apartment adjacent to Gladys, a move which does not seem to rouse her curiosity, and the two become platonic friends.
It Should Happen to You	33	72	Sheppard is, however, exasperated by Gladys' fascination with her signs and her requests he tour the city with her to see them.
It Should Happen to You	34	72	Citygoers are intrigued by the mysterious signs.
It Should Happen to You	35	72	Gladys shops in a department store (Macy's), and when she gives her name, the word spreads quickly and dozens of people flock around to get the autograph of the famous Gladys Glover.
It Should Happen to You	36	72	Soon, she is being asked to appear on television shows.
It Should Happen to You	37	72	However, the round of publicity begns to take an unpleasant turn.
It Should Happen to You	38	72	Gladys explains she obtained the signs simply in order to, "Make a name for herself," but does not seem to be aware she is being treated as a figure of fun.
It Should Happen to You	39	72	Evan Adams III, however, decides she is ripe for exploitation as, "The average American girl," and hires her to do a series of advertisements for Adams Soap.
It Should Happen to You	40	72	As Gladys pursues what is becoming a lucrative career, relations between her and Pete become strained.
It Should Happen to You	41	72	At the same time, Adams is showing an increasing interest in her.
It Should Happen to You	42	72	The situation reaches a crisis when Gladys breaks a date with Pete in order to attend what Adams says is a business conference to discuss a cross-country publicity tour.
It Should Happen to You	43	72	The conference turns out to be an attempted seduction.
It Should Happen to You	44	72	As Adams reaches to embrace Gladys, she accidentally or intentionally spills a full glass of champagne down the back his neck, breaking the spell.
It Should Happen to You	45	72	Gladys says, "I don't mind the way you're acting, exactly.
It Should Happen to You	46	72	What I mind is the way you give the idea you're sort of entitled".
It Should Happen to You	47	72	Adam then says, "Maybe I am.
It Should Happen to You	48	72	Oh, sure, if you want to make it into a sort of business proposition.
It Should Happen to You	49	72	That's what you're doing, isn't it.
It Should Happen to You	50	72	" Gladys says, "The way it looks to me, mr Adams, is that there are two sorts of people.
It Should Happen to You	51	72	The people who will do anything to make a name for themselves, and the people who will do almost anything.
It Should Happen to You	52	72	Soon there will be signs all over saying I'm the average American girl.
It Should Happen to You	53	72	That was your idea wasn't it.
It Should Happen to You	54	72	Well, I don't think the average American girl should do.
It Should Happen to You	55	72	this" then Gladys walks out.
It Should Happen to You	56	72	When she arrives home she finds a 16&nbsp;mm movie projector in her room with a note from Pete telling her to run it.
It Should Happen to You	57	72	A film plays complete with titles and synchronized sound, entitled "Goodby, [sic] Gladys".
It Should Happen to You	58	72	The charmingly self-deprecating Pete confesses he loves Gladys, acknowledges that his profile is not as good looking as Adams', and says goodbye.
It Should Happen to You	59	72	Gladys' advertising career continues, but she finds its emptiness more and more frustrating.
It Should Happen to You	60	72	She recalls Pete's frequent questions as to why she wants to be above the crowd instead of being happy being part of the crowd.
It Should Happen to You	61	72	In the meantime, Pete continues to make a go of his documentary film career.
It Should Happen to You	62	72	In a cage at a zoo, he makes a documentary showing how the visitors appear to the animals.
It Should Happen to You	63	72	He coaches the crowd to react to him as if he was a chimpanzee and he jumps around in the cage, filming the crowd, as they throw him peanuts.
It Should Happen to You	64	72	Suddenly, the crowd's attention is distracted by the sound of an airplane.
It Should Happen to You	65	72	Puzzled, Pete looks up and sees the plane has skywritten the message, "PETE CALL GLADYS PLEASE".
It Should Happen to You	66	72	He grins, the film cuts to Gladys and Pete driving in a car and discussing plans for the future.
It Should Happen to You	67	72	Gladys spots an empty billboard with a message, "THIS SPACE FOR RENT.
It Should Happen to You	68	72	Apply Acme Realty Co".
It Should Happen to You	69	72	Gladys looks to be pondering the possibilities; seeing this a concerned Pete says "What are you looking at.
It Should Happen to You	70	72	" Gladys quickly reflects all her troubles that started with her name placed on signs and as she lovingly embraces Pete responds, "Nothing, absolutely nothing.
It Should Happen to You	71	72	".
Out to Sea	0	25	Compulsive gambler Charlie Gordon, cons his close friend and brother-in-law, widower Herb Sullivan, whose recently deceased wife, Susie Gordon-Sullivan, was Charlie's sister, into an all expenses-paid luxury Holland America Mexican cruise.
Out to Sea	1	25	The catch, which Charlie does not reveal to Herb until the ship has left port, is that they are required to work as dance hosts and must sleep in a cramped cabin in the bowels of the ship.
Out to Sea	2	25	If they don't not dance, they will get fired and have to pay nearly up 3,000 dollars for the cruise, or get thrown off the ship.
Out to Sea	3	25	Ruled over by tyrannical, control-freak cruise director Gil Godwyn ("a song and dance man raised on a military base"), they do their best, despite Charlie's not actually being able to dance.
Out to Sea	4	25	Each meets a lady of interest.
Out to Sea	5	25	One is the luscious heiress Liz LaBreche, whose wealth attracts Charlie every bit as much as the rest of her does.
Out to Sea	6	25	The other is lovely widow Vivian who was a successful book editor, who is under the impression that Herb is really a doctor, not a dancer.
Out to Sea	7	25	Liz came on board on the ship with his daughter and her newlywed husband to help her start dating again.
Out to Sea	8	25	After finally telling her the truth, Herb soon finds himself quite attracted to Vivian, and eventually the feeling becomes mutual.
Out to Sea	9	25	However, because Herb still pines for the day Susie will suddenly come back to him, this conflicts his very strong feelings for Vivian, leading him to eventually stand her up on the day that they were supposed to view the rare solar eclipse together.
Out to Sea	10	25	Herb doesn't know that Vivian is broke and he came on board this ship, to land a rich man.
Out to Sea	11	25	Herb decides against starting a new relationship with Vivian until Charlie reminds that Susie was his sister, long before she was Herb's wife, emphasizing that Susie would never want Herb to spend the rest of his life completely alone and unhappy.
Out to Sea	12	25	(Charlie: "Will you stop using Susie as a safety net.
Out to Sea	13	25	" Herb: "Wait a minute.
Out to Sea	14	25	Who in the hell are you to tell me.
Out to Sea	15	25	" Charlie: "She was my sister before she was your wife.
Out to Sea	16	25	And if she were here now, she'd tell ya the same thing".
Out to Sea	17	25	Herb: "Ah, but she is not here now, is she Charlie.
Out to Sea	18	25	She's gone".
Out to Sea	19	25	Charlie: "That's right Herb, but you're not".
Out to Sea	20	25	).
Out to Sea	21	25	By the time Charlie literally drags ship owner mrs Carruthers across the dance floor, the boys aren't sure if they will find true love or need to abandon ship.
Out to Sea	22	25	Liz and her mother are revealed to be gold-digging frauds, just like Charlie, but as they make their getaway with Vivian on a plane, Herb and Charlie call out to all to come back.
Out to Sea	23	25	Charlie and Liz still continue dating, but Charlie made some good money that he won on a poker game from a rich guy.
Out to Sea	24	25	Herb is now dating Vivan now.
Champagne for Caesar	0	55	Beauregard Bottomley (Ronald Colman) is an unemployed PhD physicist who lives in Los Angeles with his piano-instructor sister Gwenn (Barbara Britton) and the alcohol-guzzling parrot of the film's title, Caesar (Mel Blanc, voice).
Champagne for Caesar	1	55	Beauregard and Gwenn live in a bungalow court, surrounded by books.
Champagne for Caesar	2	55	Beauregard is an omnivorous reader, and is highly knowledgeable on virtually any subject - except, as he admits, how to hold a job.
Champagne for Caesar	3	55	Beauregard obtains word of a mysterious job opportunity at the Milady Soap Company.
Champagne for Caesar	4	55	He meets the eccentric company owner, Burnbridge Waters (Vincent Price), for the job interview.
Champagne for Caesar	5	55	Waters disapproves of Beauregard's humour and turns him down for the job, humiliating him in the process.
Champagne for Caesar	6	55	Later, in front of an appliance store window, Beauregard, Gwenn and a small crowd, none of whom have TV sets yet, watch the radio quiz show - just transferred to the new medium of television - Masquerade for Money, whose sponsor is Milady Soap.
Champagne for Caesar	7	55	The show's format features contestants costumed as historical characters or items, who are asked questions about who or what their attire represents.
Champagne for Caesar	8	55	The prize doubles with each successive question, in the style of the 1940s radio show The $64 Question.
Champagne for Caesar	9	55	If anyone misses just one question, the contestant loses all that was won to that point.
Champagne for Caesar	10	55	Beauregard is contemptuous of television and what he deems as its anti-intellectual nature, after seeing Masquarade for Money.
Champagne for Caesar	11	55	However, after seeing the contestants struggle to answer relatively easy questions, Beauregard plots revenge on Burnbridge Waters.
Champagne for Caesar	12	55	He goes on the program dressed as an encyclopedia to let the host know he will answer any question given to him by the show's host, Happy Hogan (Art Linkletter).
Champagne for Caesar	13	55	Starting from an initial $5 prize, Beauregard easily answers the maximum five questions, then asks for a sixth question.
Champagne for Caesar	14	55	The show runs out of time, but Beauregard promises to come back the next week if people will write in to Milady Soap demanding he be allowed to return.
Champagne for Caesar	15	55	An avalanche of mail inspires Burnbridge Waters.
Champagne for Caesar	16	55	He decides to call Bottomley back for one question per show - and when they've reached a new high in soap sales, the show will drop him.
Champagne for Caesar	17	55	Masquerade for Money becomes a ratings triumph.
Champagne for Caesar	18	55	The country tunes in each week to watch Beauregard, who appears with Caesar on the covers of Look and Life Magazines.
Champagne for Caesar	19	55	The questions become more erudite and challenging, but Bottomley keeps answering them with ease.
Champagne for Caesar	20	55	With Beauregard's continuing success and increasing prize amount, Waters becomes uneasy, as the winnings will potentially erode Milady's profits.
Champagne for Caesar	21	55	Visiting the soap factory one day, Beauregard finally explains to Waters that his ultimate goal is, first, to break Waters by winning $40 million - the entire worth of Milady Soap - and thus drive Waters into bankruptcy.
Champagne for Caesar	22	55	As Beauregard continues to answer the questions, Waters calls in "Flame" O'Neill (Celeste Holm) to try to weaken Waters via seduction, to find a subject where his knowledge is lacking.
Champagne for Caesar	23	55	In parallel, Happy Hogan tries to work his charms on Gwenn to see if he also can persuade her to have Beauregard simply pocket his winnings to date, by taking piano lessons with her and asking her out.
Champagne for Caesar	24	55	Beauregard has become ill with a cold, and Flame insinuates herself into the Bottomley household as Beauregard's nurse, pretending to be a member of his fan club.
Champagne for Caesar	25	55	With little past experience with women, Beauregard initially succumbs to Flame's charms, and loses his general sang-froid in her presence.
Champagne for Caesar	26	55	Gwenn is suspicious of Flame's motives, as Beauregard is suspicious of Hogan's motives in suddenly taking piano lessons with her.
Champagne for Caesar	27	55	Neither sibling is to be deterred by the other from their respective romantic attachments.
Champagne for Caesar	28	55	Flame, a la Delilah, intends to seduce Bottomley to find out his Achilles' heel, a subject that will stump him.
Champagne for Caesar	29	55	Slowly, Beauregard becomes suspicious of Flame, after his recovery.
Champagne for Caesar	30	55	He reveals to her on one date that he (supposedly) never quite mastered Albert Einstein's theory of relativity.
Champagne for Caesar	31	55	With that knowledge, the next question on Masquerade for Money is for Beauregard to explain Einstein's theory.
Champagne for Caesar	32	55	Now realizing Flame's role in the situation, Beauregard does struggle for an answer, which he provides.
Champagne for Caesar	33	55	However, Happy Hogan indicates that, by his answer card, the response is wrong.
Champagne for Caesar	34	55	Waters rejoices as the studio audience groans, and Beauregard wanders into the wings, apparently defeated.
Champagne for Caesar	35	55	However, a phone call arrives a moment later, from Einstein himself, who has been watching the show.
Champagne for Caesar	36	55	Einstein explains that in fact, Bottomley gave the correct answer.
Champagne for Caesar	37	55	Hogan announces the news to a now jubilant audience.
Champagne for Caesar	38	55	Waters faints, and Bottomley is to return next week.
Champagne for Caesar	39	55	In the meantime, Happy appears to have genuinely fallen in love with Gwenn.
Champagne for Caesar	40	55	Flame also has apparently developed some remorse at her part in the plot against Beauregard, and also affection for him.
Champagne for Caesar	41	55	Waters decides to rent the Hollywood Bowl for the final question of the final show.
Champagne for Caesar	42	55	Before the last show, with the prize stakes at $20 million, Beauregard and Gwenn decide to test each other's romantic partners and respective engagements.
Champagne for Caesar	43	55	Each sibling telephones the respective partner to see if they would be willing to be married before the big prize day.
Champagne for Caesar	44	55	Happy and Flame each come up with excuses for not marrying Gwenn and Beauregard before the last prize show, which deflates both siblings.
Champagne for Caesar	45	55	At the Hollywood Bowl, after a sardonic introduction from Waters, Beauregard comes onstage, where Happy asks for his wallet.
Champagne for Caesar	46	55	Happy then asks a very simple question about Beauregard himself, and not about any subject in a book, namely, what is Beauregard's Social Security number.
Champagne for Caesar	47	55	Beauregard answers incorrectly, to the tremendous relief of Waters and the disappointment of the crowd.
Champagne for Caesar	48	55	Back home, Beauregard and Gwenn appear disappointed.
Champagne for Caesar	49	55	However, later that evening, Happy and Flame appear, willing to marry Gwenn and Beauregard respectively after all.
Champagne for Caesar	50	55	Waters also appears, with gifts for Beauregard.
Champagne for Caesar	51	55	It turns out that Caesar used to be Waters' pet parrot.
Champagne for Caesar	52	55	As Beauregard and Flame drive off to be married, Beauregard reveals that he and Waters agreed to a backroom deal where he would lose, but receive his own radio show, as well as Milady Soap stock.
Champagne for Caesar	53	55	However, Beauregard then admits that he genuinely didn't know the answer to the simple question posed to him at the Hollywood Bowl.
Champagne for Caesar	54	55	Even so, most anyone watching the movie might well think Beauregard must have known the answer, or else he could not have completed any job applications requiring that information.
Defending Your Life	0	24	Daniel Miller (Albert Brooks), a Los Angeles advertising executive, dies in a car accident on his 39th birthday and is sent to the afterlife.
Defending Your Life	1	24	He arrives in Judgment City, a Purgatory-like waiting area populated by the recently deceased of the western half of the United States, where he is to undergo the process of having his life on Earth judged.
Defending Your Life	2	24	Daniel and the rest of the recently deceased are offered many Earth-like amenities and activities in the city while they undergo their judgment processes—from all-you-can-eat restaurants (which cause no weight gain and serve the best food), to bowling alleys and comedy clubs.
Defending Your Life	3	24	His defense attorney, Bob Diamond (Rip Torn), explains to Daniel that people from Earth use so little of their brains (only three to five percent) that they spend most of their lives functioning on the basis of their fears.
Defending Your Life	4	24	"When you use more than five percent of your brain, you don't want to be on Earth, believe me," says Diamond.
Defending Your Life	5	24	If the court determines that Daniel has conquered his fears, he will be sent on to the next phase of existence, where he will be able to use more of his brain and thus be able to experience more of what the universe has to offer.
Defending Your Life	6	24	Otherwise, his soul will be reincarnated on Earth to live another life in another attempt at moving past his fears.
Defending Your Life	7	24	Daniel's judgment process is presided over by two judges (played by Lillian Lehman and George Wallace).
Defending Your Life	8	24	Diamond argues that Daniel should move onto the next phase.
Defending Your Life	9	24	His formidable opponent is Lena Foster (Lee Grant).
Defending Your Life	10	24	Diamond informs Daniel that she is known as "the Dragon Lady".
Defending Your Life	11	24	Each utilizes video-like footage from select days in the defendants' lives, shown to the judges to illustrate their case.
Defending Your Life	12	24	During the procedure, Daniel meets and falls in love with Julia (Meryl Streep), a woman who lived a seemingly perfect life of courage and generosity, especially compared to his.
Defending Your Life	13	24	(She died after slipping on the ground and falling into her pool and drowning) The proceedings do not go well for Daniel.
Defending Your Life	14	24	Foster shows a series of episodes in which Daniel did not overcome his fears, as well as various other bad decisions and mishaps.
Defending Your Life	15	24	The final nail in his coffin, it seems, is when Foster, on the last day of arguments, plays footage of his previous night with Julia, in which he declines to sleep with her, for what Foster believes is his same fear and lack of courage.
Defending Your Life	16	24	It is ruled that Daniel will return to Earth.
Defending Your Life	17	24	Meanwhile, Julia is judged worthy to move on.
Defending Your Life	18	24	Before saying goodbye Diamond comforts Daniel with the knowledge that the court is not infallible and just because Foster won it doesn't mean she's right.
Defending Your Life	19	24	Daniel remains disappointed.
Defending Your Life	20	24	Daniel finds himself strapped to a seat on a tram poised to return to Earth, when he spots Julia on a different tram.
Defending Your Life	21	24	On impulse, he unstraps himself, escapes from the moving tram, and risks electrocution and injury to get to Julia.
Defending Your Life	22	24	Although he cannot enter her tram at first, the entire event is being monitored by Foster and Diamond, who convinces the judges that this last-minute display of courage has earned Daniel the right to move on.
Defending Your Life	23	24	The judges agree and open the doors on Julia’s tram, allowing Daniel in, reuniting him with Julia, and allowing them to move on to the next phase of existence together.

Doc Hollywood	0	26	Dr.
Doc Hollywood	1	26	Benjamin Stone is a promising young surgeon working in Washington,C.
Doc Hollywood	2	26	with plans of making more money working for a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon.
Doc Hollywood	3	26	On his last day, he realizes that none of his colleagues care enough about him to say good-bye to him, instead leaving him a cake with an insult made out of icing.
Doc Hollywood	4	26	Driving out west in a 1956 Porsche 356 Speedster, Stone swerves to miss a cow on the highway and crashes uncontrollably into the fence of a local resident in the rural hamlet of Grady, South Carolina.
Doc Hollywood	5	26	The resident is local Judge Evans, who sentences him to community service at the nearby hospital as punishment rather than allow Stone pay for the fence with cash.
Doc Hollywood	6	26	Defeated and stranded due to the damage to his car, Ben reports to the local clinic, where Nurse Packer further humbles him by recording his community service hours by clocking him in and out, like a factory worker.
Doc Hollywood	7	26	Though upset, Ben makes friends with Mayor Nick Nicholson, who is also the owner of the town's cafe, and Melvin, the local mechanic tasked with repairing his car.
Doc Hollywood	8	26	Ben soon finds the clinic work is more laid-back than the emergency room to which he is used with simple cases, such as spots before the eyes of an elderly patient not cleaning her glasses, fishing hook impaling and even reading mail for a young illiterate couple, Kyle and Mary Owens, whose baby he later delivers.
Doc Hollywood	9	26	The small-town experience soon humbles Ben when he misdiagnoses a young boy as having mitral valve regurgitation leading to late cyanosis, a case the town's curmudgeonly doctor, Aurelius Hogue, treats with a Coca-Cola.
Doc Hollywood	10	26	Hogue explains that the boy had chewed his father's tobacco and was given too much bismuth subnitrate as an antacid, causing a blue tinge; the carbonic acid component of the soda would relieve his stomachache.
Doc Hollywood	11	26	The two finally bond when Ben saves Hogue after he suffers a near-fatal heart attack.
Doc Hollywood	12	26	Since Hogue is eager to retire, Ben is urged by the locals to stay and replace him, although he is tempted by his budding romance with a tomboyish ambulance driver, Vialula, better known as "Lou," a single mother to a four-year-old named Emma.
Doc Hollywood	13	26	Ben soon confides to her that he grew up in a small town in rural Indiana, where his parents lived and died, and how he can't see himself confined to a small town.
Doc Hollywood	14	26	Lou is also pursued by Hank Gordon, a local insurance salesman.
Doc Hollywood	15	26	He waits for Ben at the mayor's lakeside lodge, where Ben has been staying.
Doc Hollywood	16	26	Ben expects a fight, but Hank explains that though he can't give Lou what Ben can, he's still a better man for her.
Doc Hollywood	17	26	After the two men talk, Ben comes to realize he's not selfless enough for a life with Lou and plans to not see her anymore.
Doc Hollywood	18	26	Ben is soon pardoned from community service for saving Hogue, allowing him to head to California for his job interview.
Doc Hollywood	19	26	With his car fixed, he tries to sneak out of town, but his departure is delayed when he finds Kyle and Mary Owens stranded by the side of the road with Mary in deep labor.
Doc Hollywood	20	26	While he's delivering their baby, a tractor trailer smashes into his Porsche and he must leave town without it: the entire town comes to see him off in a taxi.
Doc Hollywood	21	26	On the West Coast, Ben's new boss, dr Halberstrom, hires him at the interview, based on an unexpected recommendation from Hogue.
Doc Hollywood	22	26	However, Ben soon tires of the superficiality of Beverly Hills, even going so far as calling to check the weather in Grady on his phone.
Doc Hollywood	23	26	The next day, he's surprised to receive a message at work from a woman with a "heavy Southern accent" and rushes to a restaurant, where he noticed his restored Porsche in the parking lot.
Doc Hollywood	24	26	Nancy Lee, the mayor's daughter, and Hank have come to California, and Hank tells Ben he took his own advice to "do what a man's gotta do".
Doc Hollywood	25	26	Ben returns to Grady, hoping to patch things up with Lou, who takes him back.
Soapdish	0	28	Celeste Talbert (Sally Field), the long-time star of the daytime drama The Sun Also Sets, is targeted by her ambitious co-star Montana Moorehead (Cathy Moriarty); Montana connives to supplant Celeste as the show's star by promising sexual favors to its producer, David Seton Barnes (Robert Downey, Jr).
Soapdish	1	28	To make the audience hate Celeste's character, Montana and David come up with a last-minute plot change in which she will accidentally kill a young, destitute deaf-mute, played by the newly-cast Lori Craven (Elisabeth Shue).
Soapdish	2	28	Despite the strong objections of head writer Rose Schwartz (Whoopi Goldberg) and Celeste herself, the scene plays out, but is interrupted by Celeste's recognition of Lori as her real-life niece.
Soapdish	3	28	Network honcho Edmund Edwards (Garry Marshall) sees potential in the relationship and makes Lori a regular cast member.
Soapdish	4	28	Montana and David seek to further unnerve Celeste by bringing back Jeffrey Anderson (Kevin Kline), an actor who Celeste arranged to be fired from The Sun Also Sets decades before, after his romantic relationship with Celeste went sour.
Soapdish	5	28	Bitter at being reduced to performing dinner theater for uninterested seniors in Florida, Jeffrey relishes the chance to needle Celeste.

Soapdish	7	28	However, when Lori and Jeffrey are about to enact a scripted onscreen kiss, Celeste stops them by revealing that Lori is actually her daughter by Jeffrey.
Soapdish	8	28	On camera, Celeste explains that she was responsible for getting Jeffrey fired because she was distraught about the pregnancy.
Soapdish	9	28	Then she went home, passed Lori off as her niece, and had her parents raise Lori, all due to pressure from the network.

Soapdish	11	28	A board meeting between the show's staff—including Rose, who speaks out in Celeste's defense—takes place thereafter, where David insists that she be fired, but he is quickly overruled as the situation has not only resulted in positive press for the show, but has generated a great deal of public sympathy for Celeste.
Soapdish	12	28	The next day, after an unpleasant exchange with Lori, Celeste goes to Jeffrey and pleads with him to speak to Lori on her behalf.
Soapdish	13	28	Jeffrey is resistant at first, but after Celeste gives him advice on how to approach her and break the ice, the conversation leads to Celeste and Jeffrey embracing.
Soapdish	14	28	Just when it seems the two are about to reconcile, Montana interrupts them and claims that she and Jeffrey slept together the previous night.
Soapdish	15	28	Disgusted, Celeste storms off, leaving the situation between her and Jeffrey even worse than before.
Soapdish	16	28	The dilemma is further inflamed when Rose—who by now is no longer angry with Celeste—shows her a tabloid newspaper proclaiming that Montana is pregnant with Jeffrey's child.
Soapdish	17	28	After an explosive exchange between the three of them takes place over this, Celeste, Jeffrey and Lori go to the head of the network with their concerns and demand that some action must be taken to solve the problem.
Soapdish	18	28	But it's Lori who delivers an ultimatum stating, "It's them or me--that is the bottom line here.
Soapdish	19	28	They go or I go.
Soapdish	20	28	"  A decision is made by the network, and the actors head into a live episode still not knowing who will be written off the show.
Soapdish	21	28	They will read their lines from a teleprompter so that the secret will be kept until the last minute.
Soapdish	22	28	It is revealed that Lori's character has "brain fever" and will die; still hoping to be rid of Celeste, Montana ad-libs and suggests that a brain transplant can save her.
Soapdish	23	28	Lori is shocked by the revelation, but in character, Celeste immediately plays along, offering her own brain for the operation.
Soapdish	24	28	Touched by the sacrifice, Lori asks Celeste and Jeffrey not to leave the show, and softens to her newfound parents.
Soapdish	25	28	Montana, desperate to stop them, reiterates that she is pregnant with Jeffrey's child, but she is publicly ruined by Rose who, with the help of vengeful Ariel Maloney (Teri Hatcher), who wanted Jeffrey for herself, reveals the secret from a high school yearbook that Montana is actually a transsexual named Milton Moorehead.
Soapdish	26	28	David is shocked and Montana flees the set, screaming in horror.
Soapdish	27	28	Later, Celeste, Jeffrey, and Lori win soap opera awards while Montana is relegated to performing dinner theater at Jeffrey's former venue.

Juwanna Mann	16	23	Jamal is fired from the team, and the Banshees, devastated at the betrayal, begin to suffer on the court as a result.
Juwanna Mann	17	23	Jamal, seeing this, decides to try to make things right again, and enters the Banshees' locker room during another game's halftime to apologize for the lies and tell them that playing with them had changed his views and attitude about basketball, women, and life in general.

Juwanna Mann	19	23	Afterwards, Jamal is called in for a hearing with the UBA's commission board.
Juwanna Mann	20	23	Despite the genuine apology and assurance by himself and Lorne that he has changed for the better, the board is still unimpressed due to the Juwanna scandal, and it first appears that Jamal's playing career is truly done for.

Meet John Doe	15	20	Mitchell, who has fallen in love with Willoughby, desperately tries to talk him out of jumping (saying another John Doe has already died for the sake of humanity), and Hanson and his neighbors tell him of their plan to restart their John Doe club.
Meet John Doe	16	20	Convinced not to kill himself, Willoughby leaves, carrying a fainted Mitchell in his arms, and Connell turns to Norton and says, "There you are, Norton.
Meet John Doe	17	20	The people.

Meet John Doe	19	20	".

The Baxter	0	46	Eliot is a dependable and reliable—though thoroughly average—young man with a streak of bad luck, terminally typecast as a nice guy in a life that mimics the clichés of typical romantic comedies.
The Baxter	1	46	In high school he was stood up by his date on Prom night when her ex-boyfriend, the most popular kid in school, swept her off her feet while Eliot was getting drinks.
The Baxter	2	46	In college, his next serious girlfriend's ex-boyfriend wooed her during a pep rally by announcing that he would abandon Lacrosse in favor of attending her audition to Juilliard.
The Baxter	3	46	During business school, he and his then-girlfriend are intercepted by one of her ex-boyfriends with a puppy.
The Baxter	4	46	Losing three girlfriends to their ex-boyfriends has made Eliot defensive at the proposition of being abandoned (yet again) and having his heart broken.
The Baxter	5	46	About a week before his wedding to his girlfriend, Caroline Swann, he discovers that she had a long-lost love in high school, Bradley, from whom she was inseparable.
The Baxter	6	46	Eliot tries to keep himself composed, but even Caroline's reassurances do not convince him that her feelings for Bradley are buried.
The Baxter	7	46	Though he makes a last-ditch effort to convince her to elope, she refuses, and Eliot starts bracing himself for the worst when Bradley drops by and begins trying to win Caroline's affections again.
The Baxter	8	46	In frustration, Eliot has a chance encounter with an office temp, Cecil (Michelle Williams), who shares the same elevator with him while he blurts out his unfortunate past.
The Baxter	9	46	As he resigns himself to losing Caroline to Bradley, Cecil offers him a ray of hope: she does not believe in "Baxters" and thinks that his predicament is avoidable.
The Baxter	10	46	The two meet up again later that night at a small club where Cecil likes to perform her original songs to finish their conversation, and Cecil states her theory: Eliot needs to take more risks.
The Baxter	11	46	His problems began in High School when he didn't ask his first girlfriend to dance because she was on crutches, and this provided the opportunity for her ex-boyfriend to reignite her passion.
The Baxter	12	46	Eliot decides to take more risks, though he is unsure on when and how to do so due to his reserved habits.
The Baxter	13	46	When Cecil has a fight with her boyfriend later that night, Eliot offers to put her up for the night.
The Baxter	14	46	The next morning, Caroline and their wedding planner (Peter Dinklage), show up early to finalize their plans.
The Baxter	15	46	Cecil wakes up Eliot, and he rushes to get ready in time for their arrival, and even though the night before had been completely innocent, he panics while getting ready and accidentally puts on Cecil's underwear instead of his own.
The Baxter	16	46	After an accidental spill, the wedding planner spots the panties on Eliot, which completely breaks down Eliot's calm.

The Baxter	19	46	After the meeting with the wedding planner, Caroline calls off the wedding.
The Baxter	20	46	Eliot, having been stood up for a dinner with his parents, goes out to a bar with his friends from work where he accidentally runs into Cecil's boyfriend, Dan (Paul Rudd), and Bradley with his current girlfriend.
The Baxter	21	46	Though awkward at first, Dan dismisses any conflict when he realizes that Eliot is "the Baxter" that Cecil mentioned and actually thanks him for letting her stay at his house when they fought.
The Baxter	22	46	Dan and Bradley (now revealed that Bradley's girlfriend is an old friend of Dan) insist that the groups spend some time together and chat, much to Eliot's chagrin.
The Baxter	23	46	Both Dan and Bradley laugh and joke with Eliot's friends, until one of them mentions that Caroline left him.
The Baxter	24	46	Depressed and upset, Eliot leaves and contemplates suicide until he is interrupted by his friend, Louis (David Wain), who gives him a pep talk on behalf of Caroline, who was worried about him.
The Baxter	25	46	On Louis' advice, he buys flowers, candies, and plans to take Caroline wherever it will take to make things right.
The Baxter	26	46	When he arrives, he finds Bradley already at Caroline's apartment, swooning over Caroline and upset about breaking up with his girlfriend.
The Baxter	27	46	They cancel his reservations to an expensive restaurant and go instead to a burger place that Bradley knows well.
The Baxter	28	46	Eliot feels awkward because of Bradley's personal connections to the owner and patrons, while Eliot's refined tastes clash with the blue-collar atmosphere.
The Baxter	29	46	Even with the owner's help, Eliot continues to feel out-of-place and eventually calls Cecil from the back of the restaurant, confessing that he feels that his marriage will be over before it begins.
The Baxter	30	46	The next day, Eliot arrives at work to find that Cecil is his temp again due to a flu going around the office.
The Baxter	31	46	When she proposes that they both go out and have a drink to celebrate their mutual misery, Eliot explains that after his phone call, the night actually got better for him.
The Baxter	32	46	After their somewhat disastrous dinner, Bradley and Caroline demanded to go dancing and accused Eliot of being neither spontaneous nor romantic; he stands up for himself and defends his actions and firmly states that he is trying his best to change for her.
The Baxter	33	46	At the end of his speech, he also reveals that he has changed his mind and now wants to go dancing with them, having convinced himself to try even harder to change for her—and reminding himself that his problems began when he didn't ask his first girlfriend to dance when he had the chance.
The Baxter	34	46	Though embarrassed, the throws caution to the wind and accepts a lighthearted dance-off against Bradley, a former break-dancer.
The Baxter	35	46	By accident, Bradley's final move, a spinning windmill, bumps Eliot in the face, both knocking him to the floor and bloodying his nose.
The Baxter	36	46	Bradley apologizes and reveals, to everyone's surprise, that he will leave the next day with his science team.
The Baxter	37	46	Though happy for him, Cecil is saddened by the news because, like Eliot, she has always seen herself as a "Baxter" and hoped that the two could commiserate together.
The Baxter	38	46	When Eliot asks what she'll do next, she mentions that Dan has a new job in Cincinnati, and she'll probably follow him there to resume her singing there.
The Baxter	39	46	At Caroline and Eliot's wedding, Bradley crashes the ceremony and declares his love for Caroline—a split second after Eliot has started his own objection—and Bradley and Caroline live happily ever after, according to Eliot.
The Baxter	40	46	He takes off immediately to catch Cecil before she leaves town, and after a near-miss, finds her at her apartment.
The Baxter	41	46	The two talk for a moment and Eliot declares his love, when the sudden appearance of one of Cecil's old boyfriends interrupts them.
The Baxter	42	46	Eliot, refusing to let history repeat itself, simply chases him off rather than let him get started with another speech.
The Baxter	43	46	The film closes with the pair performing in the same club where they had their first date, with Cecil singing one of her songs and Eliot playing the piano to back her up.
The Baxter	44	46	In a mid-credits scene, the film returns to Eliot catching Cecil about to leave with Dan for Cincinnati.
The Baxter	45	46	Narration begins, mirroring the narration done by Eliot in the beginning of the film, with Dan revealing himself to be a Baxter as well, describing his lament at losing the girl (Cecil) to the leading man (Eliot).

The Flame of New Orleans	7	51	Desperate to the beautiful Claire again, Charles sends his valet over to Claire's maid Clementine after the opera.
The Flame of New Orleans	8	51	The maid forwards the message, asking Claire to meet with Charles in the park.
The Flame of New Orleans	9	51	Claire and the maid make a plan to let a man harass Claire in the park, so that Charles can come to her "rescue".
The Flame of New Orleans	10	51	But even the simplest plans go wrong, and on the way to the park Claire's carriage runs over a monkey by accident.
The Flame of New Orleans	11	51	The monkey belongs to river boat captain Robert Latour.

The Flame of New Orleans	14	51	After this incident, where Charles was not only stood up by Claire since the carriage never arrived, but also deprived of a chance to come to her aid, he swears to avenge Robert Latour's insolent behaviour.

Just Friends	6	37	Prior to Christmas, Chris's employer, company CEO KC (Stephen Root), asks Chris to accompany an emerging self-obsessed pop singer named Samantha James (Anna Faris) to Paris to ensure she signs with their label, an order to which Chris reluctantly complies.

For Scent-imental Reasons	2	34	The perfumer notices a black female cat (not named in this short, the black cat character is identified as such in the much later Carrotblanca as Penelope Pussycat), and with rage flings her into the store and demands her to "Remove that skunk, that polecat pole from the premises.
For Scent-imental Reasons	3	34	Avec.
For Scent-imental Reasons	4	34	".
For Scent-imental Reasons	5	34	The cat slides into the shop, hitting a bureau and causing a bottle of white dye to spill and run down her back and tail (a black cat acquiring a white, skunk-like stripe is a running gag in most Pepé Le Pew shorts).
For Scent-imental Reasons	6	34	Pepé Le Pew sees her and immediately mistakes her for a skunk.
For Scent-imental Reasons	7	34	The cat smells Pepé's odor and immediately tries to run away, chased by Pepé.
For Scent-imental Reasons	8	34	As she attempts to wiggle free from Pepé's embrace, he makes comments like, "it is love at sight first, no.
For Scent-imental Reasons	9	34	" and "we will make beautiful music together".

For Scent-imental Reasons	11	34	She runs to a window and tries to open it, but it is stuck.
For Scent-imental Reasons	12	34	She finally takes refuge inside a locked glass cabinet, much to Pepé's chagrin.
For Scent-imental Reasons	13	34	Pepé first tries to lure her out sweetly, then demands that she come out of the cabinet.
For Scent-imental Reasons	14	34	She refuses, indicating that it is due to his odor.

For Scent-imental Reasons	16	34	Panicked, the cat rushes out to save him, only to run directly into Pepé's arms.
For Scent-imental Reasons	17	34	He tells her, "I missed, fortunately for you".
For Scent-imental Reasons	18	34	The chase continues until Pepé finds the cat on the windowsill.
For Scent-imental Reasons	19	34	He believes that she is trying to prove her love for him by committing suicide, and declares that he will save her.
For Scent-imental Reasons	20	34	Pepé grabs for her, but she slips through his arms.
For Scent-imental Reasons	21	34	Pepé then calls out: "Vive l'amour, we die together" and steps off the window ledge.
For Scent-imental Reasons	22	34	The cat falls into a barrel of water under a rain-spout, while Pepé lands in a can of blue paint.
For Scent-imental Reasons	23	34	The water washes the white stripe off the cat, and also gives her a cold.
For Scent-imental Reasons	24	34	When Pepé climbs out he is blue.
For Scent-imental Reasons	25	34	He sees the ragged-looking, sneezing wet cat but does not recognize her.
For Scent-imental Reasons	26	34	He wanders off to find the "beautiful young lady skunk".
For Scent-imental Reasons	27	34	The soaked black cat watches his blue form walking away and she falls for him.
For Scent-imental Reasons	28	34	When Pepé goes back into the perfume shop to look for the female skunk, he hears the door shut and the lock click behind him.
For Scent-imental Reasons	29	34	When he turns, he sees the drenched female cat leering at him and begins to panic, realizing that he is now the victim of love.
For Scent-imental Reasons	30	34	She drops the key to the lock down her neckline as the startled Pepé says, "Oh, no.
For Scent-imental Reasons	31	34	" and runs away.
For Scent-imental Reasons	32	34	As Pepé runs as fast as he can, the cat follows using Pepé's familiar hopping pace.
For Scent-imental Reasons	33	34	The short ends with Pepé telling the audience: "You know, it is possible to be too attractive," while continuing to run.

Gidget Goes Hawaiian	22	69	The next day, we see Gidget surfing with a very annoyed Abby (who is afraid of the water) looking on from the beach.
Gidget Goes Hawaiian	23	69	The guys watch in amazement as Gidget shows off her surfing moves, prompting Eddie to ask her for surfing lessons.
Gidget Goes Hawaiian	24	69	After Eddie wipes out on his first attempt, he and Gidget run back on shore where they kiss.

Gidget Goes Hawaiian	38	69	except a husband.

Gidget Goes Hawaiian	40	69	She implies to her mother that Gidget has slept with Eddie and other guys, rationalizing that it is half-true because Gidget had said that she gave herself "completely to that Moondoggie person".
Gidget Goes Hawaiian	41	69	Mitzi relays this to Dorothy, who refuses to believe it.
Gidget Goes Hawaiian	42	69	Even after Gidget herself denies even the thought of such a thing, arguments about it break out between the adults.

Gidget Goes Hawaiian	49	69	However, Gidget still can't bring herself to go to the Luau since she doesn't know how far Abby's rumor has spread, so she goes for a walk alone on the beach and pictures herself promiscuous and pregnant.
Gidget Goes Hawaiian	50	69	Back at the Luau, Abby tells Jeff about the rumor that Gidget sleeps around, admitting that it's a lie and that Gidget only had one affair with a guy named "Moondoggie".

Girl Shy	0	31	Harold Meadows (Lloyd) is a tailor's apprentice for his uncle in Little Bend, California.
Girl Shy	1	31	He is so shy around women that he can barely speak to them (to stop his stuttering, his uncle has to blow a whistle).
Girl Shy	2	31	Despite this, Harold writes a "how to" book for young men entitled "The Secret of Making Love", detailing how to woo different types of young women, such as "the vampire" and "the flapper" (in scenes that parodied two other popular films of the time, Trifling Women and Flaming Youth), and takes a train to see a publisher in Los Angeles.
Girl Shy	3	31	The same day, rich young Mary Buckingham (Ralston) boards the same train after her automobile breaks down in Little Bend.
Girl Shy	4	31	No dogs are allowed aboard, so she hides her Pomeranian under her shawl, but her pet jumps off as the train pulls away.
Girl Shy	5	31	Harold rescues her dog and helps Mary hide it from the conductor.
Girl Shy	6	31	She sees his manuscript, so he starts telling her about his book, overcoming his stuttering in his enthusiasm.
Girl Shy	7	31	They become so absorbed in each other that neither realizes that the train has reached its final destination and everyone else has departed.
Girl Shy	8	31	Upon returning home, Mary rejects the latest in a string of marriage proposals from persistent suitor Ronald DeVore, a rich man almost twice her age.
Girl Shy	9	31	After her car is repaired, Mary intentionally detours through Little Bend repeatedly, hoping to see Harold again.
Girl Shy	10	31	On one such trip, Ronald is also along for the ride, and his unwanted attentions cause Mary to swerve and get her car stuck near the outskirts of Little Bend.
Girl Shy	11	31	While Ronald walks back to town for a tow, Mary runs into Harold.
Girl Shy	12	31	After telling Mary about the remainder of his book, Harold informs her that he is going to see the publisher, Roger Thornby, in a few days to deliver a new chapter that will be about her.
Girl Shy	13	31	They agree to meet again afterward.
Girl Shy	14	31	Meanwhile, Ronald runs into a middle-aged woman who asks if he is finally going to introduce her to his family, but he stalls, then rides away in the tow-vehicle.
Girl Shy	15	31	mr Thornby's professional readers find Harold's book hilariously absurd, so he rejects it.
Girl Shy	16	31	Without any royalty money, Harold figures he cannot ask Mary to marry him.
Girl Shy	17	31	So he pretends that he was only using her as part of his research.
Girl Shy	18	31	Heartbroken, Mary impulsively agrees to marry Ronald.
Girl Shy	19	31	Afterward, though, one of mr Thornby's senior employees convinces him that, if the staff liked the book so much, there must be a market for it, so Thornby decides to publish it as "The Boob's Diary".
Girl Shy	20	31	A few days later, a depressed Harold gets a letter from the publisher, but just rips it up without opening it, assuming that it is a rejection notice.
Girl Shy	21	31	Fortunately, his uncle notices that one of the scraps is part of an advance royalty check for $3,000; the accompanying letter states that the book will be published as a comedy.
Girl Shy	22	31	At first, Harold is outraged, but then he realizes that he can propose to Mary after all.
Girl Shy	23	31	However, when he sees a newspaper headline announcing Mary and Ronald's wedding that same day at her family's estate, he gives up.
Girl Shy	24	31	By chance, the same woman whom Ronald had met a few days earlier walks in and, seeing the newspaper story, tearfully exclaims that she is Ronald's wife.
Girl Shy	25	31	As proof, she shows Harold a locket with the couple's wedding portrait and the engraved words "to my wife" that Ronald had given her two years earlier.
Girl Shy	26	31	Harold embarks on a frenzied headlong dash, involving bootleggers, car chases and multiple changes of vehicle (from missing the train to various cars to a trolley to a police motorcycle to a horse-drawn wagon to horseback), through the countryside and along the crowded streets of Culver City and Los Angeles.
Girl Shy	27	31	He bursts in just in time, but he cannot stop stuttering long enough to expose Ronald's intended bigamy.
Girl Shy	28	31	So Harold simply carries Mary off.
Girl Shy	29	31	When they are alone, he tells her about Ronald's secret and shows her the locket.
Girl Shy	30	31	Mary gets Harold to propose (with an assist from a passing mail carrier's whistle), and she accepts.

Stay Hungry	0	40	Craig Blake (Jeff Bridges) is a young Southern man born of a wealthy family, but left lonely and idle after his parents died in a plane crash.
Stay Hungry	1	40	He is content to spend his time fishing, hunting and puttering around his large family mansion, inhabited only by himself and a butler (Scatman Crothers).
Stay Hungry	2	40	Blake's "job" is a sinecure working at a shady investment firm run by a slick con artist named Jabo (Joe Spinell) and he does very little actual work.
Stay Hungry	3	40	But since he has to have his name "on paper" somehow as an employee, he is asked to personally transact the purchasing of a small gym that the real estate firm is buying in order to clear space for an office high-rise.
Stay Hungry	4	40	He initially approaches the gym representing himself as a businessman looking to buy it, and acts relatively impersonal with its staff, although he is strangely fascinated with the world he discovers there (reflecting the expansion of physical exercise to the mainstream which occurred in the 1970s).
Stay Hungry	5	40	But Blake's primary social life is centered around the upscale country club he attends.
Stay Hungry	6	40	The audience is introduced to the ritzy country club crowd, including the WASP-y Lester (Ed Begley, Jr) and the roguish rake Halsey (John David Carson).
Stay Hungry	7	40	Blake spends his time at this club with his friends playing tennis and shooting poker dice, and flirting with the upper-class women of all ages - one of whom asks Blake to find an "authentic" musical guest for an upcoming party at the club.
Stay Hungry	8	40	As Blake moves forward with his business deal, he falls in love with the gym after visiting it several times - he is immediately taken by the pretty receptionist Mary Tate Farnsworth (Sally Field) and the free-spirited, friendly bodybuilder Joe Santo (Schwarzenegger), who aspires to win the mr Universe title.
Stay Hungry	9	40	He cannot bring himself to sell out his newfound friends at the gym for the sake of his job, and so he evades the inquiries of his friend and coworker Hal Foss as to his progress in the purchasing deal.
Stay Hungry	10	40	All the while, he grows closer to Mary Tate and Joe Santo - who initially appear to be a couple.
Stay Hungry	11	40	However, Mary Tate latches onto Craig romantically - and Santo gives Craig his blessing for this unorthodox relationship, claiming that he needs to keep himself challenged both in the gym and in his romantic life in order to succeed.
Stay Hungry	12	40	Mary Tate and Craig begin a passionate and exciting relationship.
Stay Hungry	13	40	But trouble erupts when he tries to integrate Mary Tate into his country-club scene.
Stay Hungry	14	40	This tension comes to a head at a party at the country club, which features Joe Santo as a musical guest, performing bluegrass songs on the violin with a small country group.
Stay Hungry	15	40	Craig, with Mary Tate as his guest (dressed inappropriately in a garish and revealing pink dress), is enthusiastic about Joe Santo's upcoming musical performance for the night.
Stay Hungry	16	40	But Craig's friends, particularly Halsey, mock Santo as a "freak" and an outcast.
Stay Hungry	17	40	When Halsey suggest that Santo disrobe and show the crowd his "tits," Craig throws a glass of Scotch in his face and tells Halsey that Santo could "crush him like an eggshell".
Stay Hungry	18	40	A fight nearly breaks out between the two, but is broken up.
Stay Hungry	19	40	Meanwhile, a bitter Halsey and his friend Packman formulate a plan to embarrass Santo.
Stay Hungry	20	40	When Santo's musical act is finally put on stage, the crowd seems enthusiastic about the music, though the hostess of the party dismisses it as a "racket".
Stay Hungry	21	40	However, Halsey and Packman drunkenly bellow at Santo and heckle the band.
Stay Hungry	22	40	Santo notices it, but stoically continues playing.
Stay Hungry	23	40	However, when Halsey screams "let's hear it for Muscle Beach symphony orchestra.
Stay Hungry	24	40	" Santo is unable to continue playing, puts down his violin and leaves the party.
Stay Hungry	25	40	Meanwhile, a frustrated Craig tries to convince Mary Tate to see him for who he really is, and not for his snobbish friends and ritzy surroundings.
Stay Hungry	26	40	The mr Universe contest is approaching fast and Santo is training hard.
Stay Hungry	27	40	But Jabo, owner of the shady real estate firm, attempts to bribe the owner of the gym, Thor Eriksen, when he realizes that Blake will not purchase the building as he was supposed to.
Stay Hungry	28	40	He plies Eriksen and his assistant Newton with drugs, booze and hookers, and on the day of the contest, they are busy with acts of debauchery as Santo is readying to take the stage - hoping to beat his rival Dougie Stewart (fellow bodybuilder Ken Waller in a memorable cameo).
Stay Hungry	29	40	While Thor is drunk and distracted with the prostitutes, Newton secretly stashes the prize money inside his handbag, and then leaves the gym with the prostitutes when they are finished - stealing the money and fleeing.
Stay Hungry	30	40	Meanwhile, Joe Santo and Dougie Stewart pose together on stage, to the theme song from the film 'Exodus' and the enthusiastic applause of the crowd.
Stay Hungry	31	40	Meanwhile, Blake visits at the gym and engages in an intense physical fight, dodging weights and gym equipment thrown by the drunken and drug-crazed Eriksen.
Stay Hungry	32	40	He finds Mary Tate at the gym, who had just moments earlier been assaulted by Eriksen in an amyl nitrite fueled rage.
Stay Hungry	33	40	When the contestants at the mr Universe show discover that the prize money has been stolen, they run after Joe Santo, who himself is actually running to try to meet Mary Tate.
Stay Hungry	34	40	The chase results in the wave of bodybuilders pouring out into the streets of Birmingham, to the amazed crowd of onlookers which sees them.
Stay Hungry	35	40	The bodybuilders take advantage of this unexpected attention to put on an impromptu posing routine for the crowd, and the members of the crowd join in, imitating the athletes' poses and enjoying themselves - an embracing of the bodybuilding lifestyle by 'normal' people which arguably represents the real-life 1970s boom of personal fitness.
Stay Hungry	36	40	The film ends with Craig sarcastically deriding his former bosses at the real-estate firm, and deciding to go into the gym business with Joe Santo.
Stay Hungry	37	40	A voice-over by his uncle Albert says, "you may not have been the Blake that we anticipated, but you are definitely Craig Blake - an identity that no one will dare challenge".
Stay Hungry	38	40	Craig has finally "found himself" and discovered a true place in the sun, and true friendships, and he mocks his former boss Jabo with an exaggerated bodybuilding pose - acting as a final burning of the bridge between his old life and his new one.
Stay Hungry	39	40	The final shot of the film shows Craig moving out of his family's mansion, passing on all of his old family memorabilia to his loyal butler, and leaving behind his old self once and for all - on the way to a new and exciting future.

The Grass Is Greener	9	13	They aim and fire once apiece inside the mansion, where the Earl is wounded in the arm while Delacro is unharmed.
The Grass Is Greener	10	13	It is soon revealed that Sellers, the family butler who loaded the pistols, made sure both men were firing blanks while he, Sellers, an expert shot, wounded the Earl with a weapon of his own.

101 Reykjavík	15	51	" he replies the only way he can: "A nothing kind of nothing".
101 Reykjavík	16	51	Not even death is a serious topic for Hlynur — intoxicating, out-all-night weekends inspire, "Each weekend I drop dead".
101 Reykjavík	17	51	He says this while lighting up a Lucky atop a snow-capped mountain, where he lies down as the snow gradually covers him up, but his plans are scuppered by rainfall melting his would-be tomb.
101 Reykjavík	18	51	His mixed up thoughts include musings about suicide: "The worst thing about AIDS as a method of suicide is that it takes so long to die from it".
101 Reykjavík	19	51	On the other hand, Hlynur's fantasy life is alive with passion and glimpses of his subconscious show us a deeply conflicted sense of self.

101 Reykjavík	21	51	During a quick trip to the suburbs for a dinner with extended family, Hlynur, so comically disturbed by the mundane family ritual (they actually gather to watch a video of last year's family dinner), imagines a bloodbath scene killing everyone at close range with a shotgun.
101 Reykjavík	22	51	When brought back to reality, Hlynur's blank slate and effortless personality come back into the fore: "I was thinking what a nice couch you have", he explains to the previously slaughtered family.
101 Reykjavík	23	51	Hlynur's confusion over the whole situation is expressed in his rather profound and imaginative musings:   There they are.
101 Reykjavík	24	51	my mother the lesbian, and my father the boozer.
101 Reykjavík	25	51	What am I then.
101 Reykjavík	26	51	The offspring of a lesbian and a boozer.
101 Reykjavík	27	51	It's like two birds of different species.
101 Reykjavík	28	51	The lesbian bird and the boozer bird.
101 Reykjavík	29	51	The boozer is a wetland bird.
101 Reykjavík	30	51	He's rather heavy.
101 Reykjavík	31	51	and needs a good run-up to get off the ground.
101 Reykjavík	32	51	He can fly for a long time and has good stamina.
101 Reykjavík	33	51	Several weeks may pass by before he gets back on the ground.
101 Reykjavík	34	51	In between he lies low and goes on the defensive.
101 Reykjavík	35	51	Especially for the first days after landing.
101 Reykjavík	36	51	The lesbian.
101 Reykjavík	37	51	Unlike the boozer.
101 Reykjavík	38	51	the lesbian is a relative newcomer to Icelandic nature.
101 Reykjavík	39	51	She is thought to have migrated from Denmark and Britain.
101 Reykjavík	40	51	Her only contact with the male bird is during conception.
101 Reykjavík	41	51	In recent years we have witnessed cases of male birds.
101 Reykjavík	42	51	who are unable to fly at all.
101 Reykjavík	43	51	The offspring of a boozer and a lesbian is the Hlynur.
101 Reykjavík	44	51	an unusually slow developer that can't fly.
101 Reykjavík	45	51	and remains with his mother for the first 30 years.
101 Reykjavík	46	51	The Hlynur is defensive by nature, but harmless.
101 Reykjavík	47	51	The film progresses as Hlynur comes to terms with his mother's love for Lola and his own feelings of inadequacy with her.
101 Reykjavík	48	51	The announcement that Lola is pregnant pushes him to the brink, making living under the same roof next to impossible for all three, but after a lot of acting out and flippant commentary Hlynur begins to see life little differently.
101 Reykjavík	49	51	The infant's arrival also symbolically coincides neatly with Hlynur's homecoming to the world outside his bedroom and a newfound contentedness.
101 Reykjavík	50	51	The strong possibility that he is the father of Lola's child has been a secret between Lola and Hlynur, and this is more than hinted at in the closing scenes of the happy household composed of mother, son, Lola, and Lola's baby who calls him Papa.

The Princess Bride	1	56	She delights in verbally abusing the farm hand Westley, whom she addresses as "farm boy", by demanding that he perform chores for her.
The Princess Bride	2	56	Westley's response to her demands is always "As you wish".
The Princess Bride	3	56	She eventually realizes that what he is really saying is, "I love you".
The Princess Bride	4	56	After Buttercup realizes, as well, that she truly and strongly loves him and confesses her mutually strong romantic feelings, Westley leaves to seek his fortune, so they can marry.
The Princess Bride	5	56	Buttercup later receives word that the Dread Pirate Roberts, who is notorious for killing all those whose vessels he boards, attacked his ship at sea.
The Princess Bride	6	56	Believing Westley dead, Buttercup sinks into abject despair, declaring, "I will never love again".
The Princess Bride	7	56	Some time later, she reluctantly agrees to marry Prince Humperdinck, heir to the throne of Florin, due to a law allowing the prince to choose any unmarried woman as his bride, though she makes it clear that she does not love him.
The Princess Bride	8	56	Before the wedding, a trio of outlaws—the Sicilian criminal genius Vizzini, the Spanish fencing master Inigo Montoya, and the enormous and mighty Turkish wrestler Fezzik—kidnap Buttercup.
The Princess Bride	9	56	A masked man in black follows them across the sea and up the Cliffs of Insanity, whereupon Vizzini orders Inigo to stop him.
The Princess Bride	10	56	Before the man in black reaches the top of the cliff, a flashback of Inigo's past in the novel reveals that he is seeking revenge on a six-fingered man who killed his father.
The Princess Bride	11	56	When the man in black arrives, Inigo arranges a fair fight, allowing his opponent to rest before the duel.
The Princess Bride	12	56	The man in black wins the duel, but out of respect, he leaves the Spaniard alive.

The Princess Bride	14	56	Another flashback occurs detailing Fezzik's history of reluctant fighting matches since childhood.
The Princess Bride	15	56	His conscience compelling him, Fezzik throws a rock as a warning and challenges the man to a wrestling match.
The Princess Bride	16	56	The man in black accepts the challenge and chokes Fezzik until the giant blacks out.
The Princess Bride	17	56	He then catches up with Vizzini and proposes a battle of wits, guessing which cup of wine is poisoned with iocaine powder.
The Princess Bride	18	56	They drink, and the man in black reveals that both cups were poisoned, but he had previously cultivated an immunity to iocaine powder.
The Princess Bride	19	56	Vizzini dies.
The Princess Bride	20	56	With Prince Humperdinck's rescue party in hot pursuit, the man in black flees with Buttercup.
The Princess Bride	21	56	He taunts Buttercup, claiming that women cannot be trusted and that she must have felt nothing when her true love and sweetheart had died.
The Princess Bride	22	56	Enraged, she shoves him into a gorge, yelling, "You can die, too, for all I care.
The Princess Bride	23	56	", only to hear him call, "As you wish.
The Princess Bride	24	56	" from the bottom of the ravine.
The Princess Bride	25	56	She realizes he is none other than her dearly beloved Westley, and follows him down into the gorge, to find him battered but largely unhurt.
The Princess Bride	26	56	While traveling through the Fire Swamp to evade Humperdinck's party, Westley tells Buttercup that the Dread Pirate Roberts did attack his ship, but kept him alive after he explained the depths of his love for her.
The Princess Bride	27	56	Westley became the Dread Pirate Roberts' valet, and later his friend.
The Princess Bride	28	56	Over the course of four years, Westley learned how to fence, fight, and sail.
The Princess Bride	29	56	Eventually, Roberts secretly passed his name, captaincy, and ship to Westley, just as his predecessor had done.
The Princess Bride	30	56	After facing many trying ordeals such as Snow Sand and Rodents of Unusual Size, Westley and Buttercup successfully navigate the Fire Swamp, whereupon they are captured by Prince Humperdinck and his cruel six-fingered assistant, Count Tyrone Rugen.
The Princess Bride	31	56	Buttercup negotiates for Westley's release and returns with Humperdinck to the palace to await their wedding.
The Princess Bride	32	56	Rugen follows Humperdinck's secret instructions to not release Westley, but to take him to the fifth level of his underground hunting arena, the "Zoo of Death".
The Princess Bride	33	56	Here, Rugen gravely tortures and weakens Westley with his horribly painful life-sucking invention, The Machine, to obtain first-hand information for completing his definitive book on pain along with appeasing Humperdinck's annoyance that Buttercup does and always will prefer Westley to him.
The Princess Bride	34	56	Meanwhile, Buttercup has several nightmares regarding her marriage to the prince.
The Princess Bride	35	56	She expresses her unhappiness to Humperdinck, who proposes a deal wherein he will send out four ships to locate Westley, but if they fail to find him, Buttercup will marry him.
The Princess Bride	36	56	The novel reveals that, to start a war with the neighboring country of Guilder, Humperdinck himself had arranged Buttercup's kidnapping and murder, but that he now believes that Buttercup dying on her wedding night will inspire his subjects to war even more effectively.
The Princess Bride	37	56	On the day of the wedding, Inigo meets again with Fezzik, who tells him that Count Rugen is the six-fingered man who killed his father.
The Princess Bride	38	56	Knowing that Vizzini is dead, they seek out the man in black hoping that, if he could outsmart Vizzini, his wits will help them plan a successful attack on the castle to find and kill Count Rugen.
The Princess Bride	39	56	Buttercup learns that Humperdinck never sent any ships, and taunts him with her enduring love for Westley.
The Princess Bride	40	56	Enraged, Humperdinck tortures Westley to death via The Machine at its maximum setting.
The Princess Bride	41	56	Westley's death screams echo across the land, drawing Inigo and Fezzik to the Zoo of Death and down through its many dangerous levels.
The Princess Bride	42	56	Finding Westley's body, they enlist the help of the King of Florin's former "miracle man", a magician named Miracle Max who was fired by Humperdinck.
The Princess Bride	43	56	Max pronounces Westley to be merely "mostly dead", and returns him to life (out of a desire to get back at Humperdinck), though Westley remains partially paralyzed and weak.
The Princess Bride	44	56	Westley devises a successful plan to invade the castle during the wedding, and the commotion caused by this prompts Humperdinck to cut the wedding short.
The Princess Bride	45	56	Buttercup decides to commit suicide when she reaches the honeymoon suite.
The Princess Bride	46	56	Inigo pursues Rugen through the castle, and, reciting aloud his long-rehearsed oath of vengeance ("Hello.
The Princess Bride	47	56	My name is Inigo Montoya.
The Princess Bride	48	56	You killed my father.
The Princess Bride	49	56	Prepare to die".
The Princess Bride	50	56	) throughout the duel, kills him in a sword fight.
The Princess Bride	51	56	Westley reaches Buttercup before she commits suicide.
The Princess Bride	52	56	Still partially paralyzed, he bluffs his way out of a sword fight with Humperdinck, who shows himself to be a coward.
The Princess Bride	53	56	Instead of killing his rival, Westley decides to leave him alive for a long, miserable life with his obvious cowardice as his only companion.
The Princess Bride	54	56	The party then rides off into the sunset on four of the prince's purebred white horses which Fezzik had conveniently discovered.
The Princess Bride	55	56	The story ends with a series of mishaps and the prince's men closing in, but the author indicates that he believes that the group got away.

A Good Year	0	29	In the prologue, a young Max Skinner, whose parents have died in an accident, spends his childhood summer holidays learning to appreciate the finer things in life at his Uncle Henry's vineyard estate in Provence in south-eastern France.
A Good Year	1	29	Some 25 years later, Max is an unethical yet very successful hard-working London-based bond trader with a sense of humour.
A Good Year	2	29	Following his uncle's death, Max is the sole beneficiary of the French property.
A Good Year	3	29	He travels to Provence to prepare a quick sale.
A Good Year	4	29	Shortly after arriving he almost knocks a local café owner, Fanny Chenal, off her bicycle as a result of his careless driving.
A Good Year	5	29	Subsequently, he discovers that his latest City financial stunt has caused real trouble for the owners of the trading company he works for, and the CEO orders him to return to London as soon as possible.
A Good Year	6	29	To assist in his planned sale of the property, Max hurriedly snaps some photos and in the process falls into an empty swimming pool.
A Good Year	7	29	He is unable to escape until Fanny Chenal, driving by and spotting his rental car, appears and turns on the water supply in retaliation.
A Good Year	8	29	This delay causes Max to miss his flight and, having failed to report to the directors in person, he is suspended from work and trading activities for one week.
A Good Year	9	29	On Henry's estate, Max must deal with a gruff, dedicated winemaker, Francis Duflot, who fears being separated from his precious vines.
A Good Year	10	29	Duflot pays a vineyard inspector to tell Max that the soil is bad and the vines worthless.
A Good Year	11	29	In the meantime, they are surprised by the unexpected arrival of young Napa Valley oenophile Christie Roberts, who is backpacking through Europe and claims to be Henry's previously unknown illegitimate daughter.
A Good Year	12	29	Like Max, Christie finds the house wine unpalatable but is impressed by Max's casual offering of the boutique Le Coin Perdu ("the lost corner") vintage, noting some intriguing characteristics.
A Good Year	13	29	Max is concerned that she might lay claim to the estate and brusquely interrogates her during dinner at the Duflot house.
A Good Year	14	29	Max gets updates on office politics from his assistant Gemma, who warns him of the ambitious antics of other employees.
A Good Year	15	29	To ensure he is not usurped by Kenny, his second-in-command in London, through whom Max continues to direct trades, Max intentionally gives the ambitious young trader bad advice, getting Kenny fired.
A Good Year	16	29	Max becomes enamoured with the beautiful, feisty café owner Fanny, who is rumoured to have sworn off men.
A Good Year	17	29	He successfully woos Fanny into his bed, where she leaves him the next morning, expecting him to return to his life in London.
A Good Year	18	29	A disillusioned Christie also decides to move on.
A Good Year	19	29	Max finds his uncle's memoirs, which contain proof of Christie's heritage.
A Good Year	20	29	However, he bids her farewell while handing her an unexplained note inside a book she was reading.
A Good Year	21	29	While informing Duflot of the pending estate sale, Max learns that the mysterious expensive Le Coin Perdu was made by Henry and Duflot with "illegal vines" from the estate, bypassing wine classification and appellation laws.
A Good Year	22	29	The estate is sold and Max returns to London where Sir Nigel, the company chairman, offers him a choice: "Money or your life" - either a discharge settlement, which includes "a lot of zeros," or the partnership in the trading firm, where he would then be "made for life".
A Good Year	23	29	Max asks about Nigel's art in the conference room, which Fanny has a copy of in her restaurant.
A Good Year	24	29	Upon Nigel's dismissive comment that the real one is kept in a vault and the $200,000 copy in the office is for show, Max reconsiders if he wants to still be like Nigel.
A Good Year	25	29	Max invalidates the estate's sale with the farewell letter he gave to Christie, which he forged, along with real photos confirming Christie as Henry's daughter with a valid claim to the estate  (as a child Max signed cheques for his uncle, and is able to replicate his handwriting and signature).
A Good Year	26	29	He puts his London residence up for sale and returns to Provence, entering into a relationship with Fanny.
A Good Year	27	29	Christie also returns and she and Francis jointly run the vineyard while trying to reconcile their vastly different philosophies of wine production.
A Good Year	28	29	Meanwhile, Max is now able to focus his entire attention on Fanny.

Two Much	16	40	Because the two "twin brothers" must never be in the same place at the same time, it however involves a lot of running around, coming up with a lot of excuses and enlisting a very reluctant Gloria's help.

Two Much	27	40	After they leave, Liz arrives to the studio, thinking Bart got beat up.
Two Much	28	40	When Bart tells her he is Art, that he fell in love when he saw her in the shower and tries to kiss her, Liz thinks Art is trying to make a pass at her, not realizing Bart doesn't exist.
Two Much	29	40	On the wedding day, Liz tells Bart his "brother" tried to kiss her, and that the wedding should be called off.
Two Much	30	40	Bart needs to "confront" Art in a study alone, with Liz and Gene listening outside -and, unbeknownst to anyone, also by Betty through the phone.
Two Much	31	40	When Gene enters the study, he confronts a lonely Art, and again threatens him if he doesn't marry Betty.
Two Much	32	40	He tells him that what Art or even himself want is irrelevant, and that the only thing that matters is Betty's happiness.

The Heavenly Kid	2	21	He dies as his car plummets over the cliff into a fiery wreck.

The Heavenly Kid	4	21	Bobby is denied entry, and Rafferty (Richard Mulligan) appears and explains that he isn't considered ready yet and needs to carry out an assignment in order to earn his ticket Uptown.
The Heavenly Kid	5	21	After many years in limbo Bobby is finally given his assignment: he is to return to Earth and act as a guardian angel and friend for Lenny Barnes (Jason Gedrick), a promising high school student who is constantly picked on in school, particularly by school bullies Fred Gallo (Stephen Gregory) and Bill McIntyre (Beau Dremann).
The Heavenly Kid	6	21	However, Bobby is instructed that he is only allowed to reveal himself to Lenny and nobody else.

The Heavenly Kid	13	21	Much like Bobby's car race, the race ends with Lenny and Bobby flying over the edge of a cliff, and the car exploding in a fiery wreck.
The Heavenly Kid	14	21	However, Bobby prevents Lenny from dying, and they climb up the cliff together.
The Heavenly Kid	15	21	Bobby helps Lenny see the error of his ways as Lenny reunites with his long-time friend Melissa (Nancy Valen), who was in love with him and by his side even during his "nerdy years".
The Heavenly Kid	16	21	After bidding an emotional goodbye to Lenny, during which he tells him that they will always be best friends, Bobby offers himself to Rafferty to fulfill his end of the bargain by accepting a ride "Downtown" (essentially, to Hell).
The Heavenly Kid	17	21	However, Rafferty explains that this will not be happening.
The Heavenly Kid	18	21	Bobby incredulously asks why, since he had made a deal to trade his own soul for Lenny's second chance at life.
The Heavenly Kid	19	21	Rafferty explains to Bobby that he had learned to love and value someone more than himself, and that is how one earned a ticket Uptown.
The Heavenly Kid	20	21	Lenny and his girlfriend then watch Bobby and Rafferty fly into the sky on a motorbike, while the movie ends with Bobby going on the escalator to Uptown.

Jump In!	0	95	Seventeen-year-old Isadore "Izzy" Daniels (Corbin Bleu) is a star boxer in Brooklyn.
Jump In!	1	95	His father Kenneth (David Reivers), a golden glove champion and widower, coaches him and encourages him to do his best, while his sassy eight-year-old sister, Karin, is much more interested in Double Dutch.
Jump In!	2	95	Mary Thomas (Keke Palmer) is a teenage girl and competitive Double Dutch player, part of a team called the Joy Jumpers, who lives next door to Izzy; the two have a complicated relationship, always arguing when they see each other, but Mary's teammates and Karin know that they have crushes on each other.
Jump In!	3	95	Izzy's boxing skills are great enough that he stands only one exhibition match away from going to the Golden Gloves; his opponent is Rodney, the only other undefeated boxer in the gym.
Jump In!	4	95	Mary and the Joy Jumpers, meanwhile, are training for the regional championship, in order to make it on to the city finals.
Jump In!	5	95	On the day of the regional championship, Izzy is forced to take Karin and her friends to watch it when his father has to deal with a problem at the gym.
Jump In!	6	95	His two best friends Chuck and Earl, fellow boxers, tag along to try to convince him to join them for the movies, as they previously planned.
Jump In!	7	95	On their way, they meet Rodney, Izzy's competition and the neighborhood bully, who asserts that he'll destroy Izzy in the ring.
Jump In!	8	95	Arriving at the site of the regional competitions, Izzy witnesses as Mary and her teammates Shauna, Keisha, and a girl named Yolanda who moved to Brooklyn from Atlanta, deal with trash talk from the Dutch Dragons, the four-time regional champions.
Jump In!	9	95	The competition is divided into three stages: compulsory, speed, and freestyle.
Jump In!	10	95	Despite his best efforts to disguise it, it becomes clear that the more Izzy watches, the more he likes.
Jump In!	11	95	In the end, the Joy Jumpers take fourth place, barely qualifying for the city finals, and after dealing with snark from Gina, the leader of the Dutch Dragons, Yolanda criticizes Mary for her freestyle routine, blaming their poor performance on them.
Jump In!	12	95	Izzy and Karin leave as the team begins to argue.
Jump In!	13	95	Shortly before Izzy's match with Rodney, he witnesses him receiving a bag of clothes from one of the teachers; while he was the toughest guy on the street, he was just a poor kid dealing with problems at home.
Jump In!	14	95	Rodney angrily throws the bag away when he catches Izzy staring.
Jump In!	15	95	Later, the two meet up at the gym, and Rodney maintains his merciless attitude before and during the match.
Jump In!	16	95	He proves to be strong, but less skilled than Izzy.
Jump In!	17	95	Kenneth instructs him to watch his movements and find his rhythm.
Jump In!	18	95	Armed with this advice, Izzy gains the advantage, and ultimately wins.
Jump In!	19	95	Later that night, he retrieves the clothes and drops the bag at Rodney's door, fleeing before the latter sees him, but lingering at a safe distance to watch as he takes the clothes inside.
Jump In!	20	95	Meanwhile, Yolanda quits the Joy Jumpers, informing Mary that she cared most about winning.
Jump In!	21	95	In a complex way, Izzy helps to cheer her up after seeing her crying from her balcony.
Jump In!	22	95	The next day, Rodney confronts Izzy at the school, saying that he won due to a trick and demanding a rematch.
Jump In!	23	95	Izzy declines, but Rodney refuses to drop the subject.
Jump In!	24	95	Elsewhere, Mary, Shauna, and Keisha debate about who can replace Yolanda, bringing up several potential candidates, all with fatal flaws.
Jump In!	25	95	Izzy overhears them, and Shauna and Keisha explain that Yolanda joined the Dutch Dragons, leaving them down a player.
Jump In!	26	95	Izzy scoffs at the alleged difficulty of jumping rope, and Mary subsequently challenges Izzy to speed jump.
Jump In!	27	95	She demonstrates her own skills first, and then allows Izzy to try.
Jump In!	28	95	He gets a false start the first time, but upon his second attempt, he demonstrates as much skill as Mary, leaving the girls (and an unseen Karin, who watches from nearby) astonished.
Jump In!	29	95	Later, at the gym, Izzy is jumping rope as part of his training, and confides to Felix, the gym's wise head coach, that he was still upset about Rodney's attitude, and Felix replies that boxing doesn't solve those kinds of problems.
Jump In!	30	95	As he leaves, the Joy Jumpers enter the gym and ask Izzy to join their team, stating that they needed his skills, but he refuses because of what his friends might think.
Jump In!	31	95	Later, he meets Shauna and Keisha at a restaurant when he orders a pizza for dinner, and they present him a different offer: to serve as a stand-in, so that they can practice with a fourth player until they find someone to serve as a permanent replacement.
Jump In!	32	95	Izzy considers the offer, and after they coerce a reluctant Mary into asking him to agree, he does so, on the condition that they practice in the gym before school, where nobody can see them.
Jump In!	33	95	They begin the next morning, where Izzy learns that while compulsory and speed jumping are easy for him with his training, freestyle is more problematic for him.
Jump In!	34	95	He develops his skills quickly, however, and the next day, demonstrates enough skill to leave the three girls astonished once more.
Jump In!	35	95	Over the next several days, Izzy spends more and more time with the Joy Jumpers and improves tremendously at Double Dutch, though his boxing skills and punctuality suffer as a result.
Jump In!	36	95	Tammy, the only girl boxer in the gym and subsequently the object of much ridicule, confides to him after beating him in a match that she knows about his practicing, and promises to keep it a secret in exchange for ceasing the jokes about her, particularly around Chuck, whom she has a crush on (which is reciprocated).
Jump In!	37	95	One day, on his way to practice, Izzy spies some girls in the street jumping rope, which gives him inspiration for his team.
Jump In!	38	95	He explains to the Joy Jumpers, particularly Mary, that the freestyle routine needed to be redone due to being too boring; he tells them that freestyle should be based on fun, and brings up their childhoods when they enjoyed jumping rope and singing along with it.
Jump In!	39	95	He takes them to see the girls he saw, which gives them the inspiration to change up their team.
Jump In!	40	95	Walking back, they pass by Rodney, who is quick to belittle Izzy and begin to get violent.
Jump In!	41	95	Mary dumps a cooler of water on his head, and the four run away, Rodney giving up the chase quickly but angrily.
Jump In!	42	95	That night, Izzy and Mary talk on their balconies, Izzy admitting that he likes Double Dutch, but having difficulty due to his father's passion for boxing.
Jump In!	43	95	Mary confides that she once felt the same way about ballet, but eventually confessed to her mother that she hated it, and her mother easily accepted it.
Jump In!	44	95	Izzy states that it's not that easy with him, and Mary gives him a quick kiss before going back to her room.
Jump In!	45	95	Going back to his own, Izzy meets his father, who sternly confronts him about missing his curfew and a practice match that day.
Jump In!	46	95	Izzy promises not to be late again, and his dad leaves, leaving Izzy alone with his thoughts.
Jump In!	47	95	The following day, Rodney and his crony, Hooks, gang up on Izzy at school, but are quickly called off thanks to a passing teacher, who puts them in detention.
Jump In!	48	95	Later on, Rodney runs by the gym, and upon hearing the music inside, enters to see Izzy and the Joy Jumpers practicing.
Jump In!	49	95	Gleefully pondering his revenge, he and Hooks snap pictures of them and leave, unseen.
Jump In!	50	95	After practice, Mary brings up that they have yet to find a fourth player, and Izzy agrees to join the team permanently, on the condition that they change the name to Hot Chili Steppers.

Jump In!	54	95	Shauna and Keisha try their hardest to convince Mary to reconsider her decision, but Mary remains obstinate.

Jump In!	62	95	Izzy apologizes, and his father quietly accepts the apology before making an excuse to leave.

Jump In!	68	95	That night, Rodney arrives at the gym as Izzy is leaving, bringing a large crowd with him.
Jump In!	69	95	He demands again that Izzy gives him the rematch he had requested, and after some mocking, Izzy agrees to it.
Jump In!	70	95	In the ring, Izzy keeps a cool head, responding to Rodney's mockery with fact, that he was angry because his father was out of work, and everyone thought of him as a loud-mouthed bully.
Jump In!	71	95	He uses the tricks he honed in freestyle practice to dodge Rodney's attacks and push him against the ropes repeatedly, finally stating that they both had a lot of things to be mad about, but fighting would not improve them.
Jump In!	72	95	He leaves the ring, and Rodney angrily follows, but trips on the rope and falls on his back.
Jump In!	73	95	Everyone urges Izzy to finish him, but he refuses, stating that he's tired of being mad before leaving the gym.

Jump In!	76	95	Izzy arrives and apologizes to Mary, who jokes around with him and smiles before handing him a uniform, and all is forgiven.
Jump In!	77	95	They once again face the Dutch Dragons before the match, Gina and Yolanda snarking at them, confident that they would win.

Jump In!	79	95	With Mary's stellar performance, the Hot Chili Steppers take first place in the compulsory competition, while the Dutch Dragons take second, much to their astonishment.

Jump In!	81	95	Other teams compete while the Hot Chili Steppers look on, and then the Dutch Dragons take their turn.
Jump In!	82	95	The Hot Chili Steppers take the stage immediately after them, and while doing so, Izzy sees his father and sister entering the arena, greeting him with a smile.
Jump In!	83	95	Thus encouraged, the Hot Chili Steppers take the stage, performing a series of freestyle jumprope tricks in conjunction with a dance number, for which they earn tumultuous applause.
Jump In!	84	95	Izzy meets his father afterwards while the judges decide the winners, and he apologizes for pushing boxing so hard, having done it motivated by wanting to connect with Izzy.
Jump In!	85	95	He accepts that boxing is his dream, not Izzy's, and says how proud he is of what he had done.
Jump In!	86	95	He then meets his friends, who state that they've been enlightened, and Chuck embraces Tammy while Earl feigns nausea.
Jump In!	87	95	Finally, seeing Rodney, he confronts him, surprised to find his hostility gone and him admitting that the Double Dutch was cool.
Jump In!	88	95	They agree on a truce, and Izzy agrees to teach his moves to Rodney later to use in the ring.
Jump In!	89	95	At last, the judges announce the winners of the State Championship, announcing the third-place winner as the Kung Fu Flyers, and the second place team as the Dutch Dragons.
Jump In!	90	95	As he is about to announce the first place team, however, the scene cuts to the gym, revealing that Rodney, a couple of years after the event, was telling the story to a group of kids, boxers in training.
Jump In!	91	95	He reveals that the Hot Chili Steppers went to the State Championship, but did not win until the following year, and that Izzy and Mary were still going strong as a couple.
Jump In!	92	95	His voiceover states that he tells kids that story all the time, but you would have had to be there that day.

Flipped	0	53	Juli Baker meets Bryce Loski two weeks before the beginning of second grade; it's something about those blue eyes that attract her.
Flipped	1	53	Julianna knows it's love, while Bryce, like any seven-year-old boy, doesn't.
Flipped	2	53	Julianna stalks Bryce all through his childhood; staring at his house, asking him to play, following him at school, etc.
Flipped	3	53	Every day, Bryce watches Julianna climb the sycamore tree at the bus stop, from which Julianna always watches the town.
Flipped	4	53	She constantly asks Bryce to come join her in the tree, as well as yelling out how far away the bus is.

Flipped	6	53	Bryce looks over his shoulder for Julianna every time he's with Shelly, which causes Julianna to think he's being forced to date her.
Flipped	7	53	This provokes a catfight between Juli and Shelly over Bryce.
Flipped	8	53	The two break up, and Bryce is back to square one.
Flipped	9	53	There comes an incident in sixth grade when, much to Bryce's chagrin and irritation, Juli constantly sniffs Bryce's hair in spelling from her assigned position behind him.
Flipped	10	53	According to Juli, his hair smells like watermelon and he has blond earlobe fuzz.
Flipped	11	53	Bryce is disgruntled from this seat change, because Juli had initially sat next to him where he could see her answers and copy off of them.
Flipped	12	53	Now that she's behind him, he's lost that advantage, and his grades slip, especially in spelling.
Flipped	13	53	This halts, however, when as Juli sniffs him, she begins to whisper answers in his ear.
Flipped	14	53	Bryce, torn between feeling grateful and awkwardly guilty for hating her so much when she's helping him, follows the answers anyway until the end of the year.
Flipped	15	53	Juli, on the other hand, can't stop thinking about Bryce in the many years she's known him.
Flipped	16	53	Obliviously missing his discomfort being around her, she continues to try to get him to like her.
Flipped	17	53	However, Juli's motives change when her beloved sycamore tree is cut down.
Flipped	18	53	Although Juli stays up in the branches for hours and misses school to protest its excision, she is brought down and isn't the same for weeks.
Flipped	19	53	Unbeknownst to Juli, Bryce feels horribly about Juli's tree, considering Juli asked Bryce to come up to protest with her and he declined.
Flipped	20	53	He frets over whether he could have made a difference, and contemplates many times apologizing to Juli but chickens out each time.
Flipped	21	53	Matters aren't helped when Bryce's wise but stubborn grandfather takes a fond liking to Juli and pesters Bryce to be friends with her—he doesn't seem to understand Bryce's annoyance with the girl.
Flipped	22	53	Juli's spirits are lightened when her father, who she admires more than anyone, paints her a picture of her sycamore tree.
Flipped	23	53	Juli often sits out with her dad on the porch for hours, listening to him talk and watching him paint.
Flipped	24	53	Juli hangs the picture in her room so she'll always be reminded of what the tree represented for her.
Flipped	25	53	Things with Juli start to change when Juli gives Bryce and his family a batch of chicken eggs.
Flipped	26	53	Bryce's father immediately expresses concern that the eggs might be fertilized, so Bryce and his best friend, Garrett, sneak over to her house and try to spy on the chickens in her backyard in search of a rooster (The chickens are a result of Juli's winning science fair project, which Bryce is a bit bitter about but means a lot to Juli) And Bryce doesn't know about the difference between chickens, hens, and roosters, so they head home without answers.
Flipped	27	53	Bryce's family, however, has a new concern,salmonella.
Flipped	28	53	Juli's yard has always been very messy, and the family is concerned about poison in the eggs.
Flipped	29	53	Bryce's father tells him to just say no to Juli about the eggs, but Bryce ends up just throwing the eggs away before his parents come down for breakfast.
Flipped	30	53	This goes on for two years, but ends when Juli catches Bryce throwing the eggs into the trash can and tells him she's lost over a hundred dollars giving him the eggs when she's been selling them to her neighbors.
Flipped	31	53	She runs home, leaving Bryce feeling miserable.
Flipped	32	53	Things take a dive for the worse in eighth grade when Juli overhears Bryce talking to Garrett about her mentally challenged uncle.
Flipped	33	53	Bryce wants to punch him (to be exact "slug him"), but doesn't want to lose his friend, so he pretends to laugh.
Flipped	34	53	Juli, furious and hurt, decides to abandon every thought of Bryce, even though Bryce's grandpa is very good friends with Juli and helps her tame her yard.
Flipped	35	53	The flip comes here: the more angry Juli is and the more she ignores him, the more Bryce notices and likes Juli, especially after he finds an old article about Juli's protest for her tree from elementary school.
Flipped	36	53	Bryce begins to see that Juli is smart, spirited and "iridescent", as Grandpa Chet calls her.
Flipped	37	53	And for once, Bryce can't get Juli out of his head, and Juli hates Bryce the way Bryce hated her.
Flipped	38	53	The climax comes at the eighth grade basket boys' luncheon, an auction in which boys are sold off to win money for charity.
Flipped	39	53	Shy Bryce hates this event, but has no choice in the matter.

Flipped	41	53	While on their lunch date, Bryce finds he can't focus on Shelly and Miranda: he just wants to talk to Juli.
Flipped	42	53	He gets his chance when Shelly and Miranda get into a huge food fight over him.
Flipped	43	53	While they're fighting, Bryce sneaks over to Juli's table, pulls her away from her date, and asks if she likes Jon.
Flipped	44	53	She answers that no, she doesn't, but is clearly still annoyed at Bryce and wants nothing to do with him.
Flipped	45	53	Bryce, in his relief, takes her hands, leans in and tries to kiss her, but she yanks back and runs away.
Flipped	46	53	Unfortunately for Bryce, this act is witnessed in front of his entire class, so he is dogged the rest of the day by taunts, especially by his friend Garrett.
Flipped	47	53	It is implied that Bryce drops Garrett as a friend in favor of Juli by the end.
Flipped	48	53	Juli manages to get home without Bryce seeing her, but Bryce is determined now.
Flipped	49	53	He calls, knocks on her door, and eventually climbs her window.
Flipped	50	53	Juli ignores him by sitting in the living room, until she looks out the window and sees Bryce's last attempt at winning her heart: he plants a sycamore tree in her backyard.
Flipped	51	53	Juli now realizes Bryce has changed and waves back at him from her living room window.
Flipped	52	53	And at that moment Juli realizes that Bryce loves her and he wants her to give him a second chance.

Take a Girl Like You	2	22	Jenny has rented a room in the home of middle-aged couple, Dick and Martha Thompson.
Take a Girl Like You	3	22	Dick is apparently some sort of auctioneer and Martha is a housewife, who is bored, cynical and at times openly hostile towards young Jenny.
Take a Girl Like You	4	22	Anna, the Thompsons' other lodger, is a changeable young woman who is apparently French.
Take a Girl Like You	5	22	Within half an hour of her arrival, Jenny meets Patrick Standish, an acquaintance of the Thompsons, who wastes no time in asking if he can ring her to arrange a date.
Take a Girl Like You	6	22	Patrick takes Jenny to what seems to her to be a fashionable, upmarket Italian restaurant but which Amis makes clear is a classless provincial pseudo-Italianate place.
Take a Girl Like You	7	22	Bowled over by Patrick's charm, Jenny accompanies him in his noisy sports car to the flat he shares with teaching colleague, Graham, who is by Patrick's arrangement, not at home.
Take a Girl Like You	8	22	A cosy session of listening to gramophone records and kissing (enough for Jenny on a first date) develops at Patrick's behest into heavy petting, which Patrick takes for granted will lead to the bedroom.
Take a Girl Like You	9	22	Jenny is adamant and is forced to pull his hair to make him stop.
Take a Girl Like You	10	22	Jenny explains, to Patrick's wonderment, that she intends to remain a virgin until she is married.
Take a Girl Like You	11	22	The rest of the novel relates, from Jenny's point of view, the progress of her relationship with Patrick, her activities as a new teacher, getting to know the people around her and a string of incidents such as a visit to Julian's house, a date with Graham and an embarrassing scene in which Dick makes a clumsy pass at her in the kitchen.
Take a Girl Like You	12	22	From Patrick's point of view, are described his activities at school, his outlook on life and the escapades that follow becoming acquainted with the urbane Julian Ormerod, who has a big house in the countryside near the town.
Take a Girl Like You	13	22	A lengthy section of the book is assigned to a trip with Julian to London, which includes a trawl around the strip-clubs of Soho, a visit to the apartment of two of Julian's lady friends, followed by a night on the town for the four of them, in which Patrick has altogether too much to drink.
Take a Girl Like You	14	22	For a time, Jenny and Patrick enjoy a carefree period of 'going steady' but this is not enough for Patrick, who finds himself sexually frustrated.

Take a Girl Like You	16	22	Patrick, after ensuring the absence of Graham, waits for her to come to his flat but she doesn't come.
Take a Girl Like You	17	22	Patrick's morals are spotlighted at this point by his going to bed with a girl who, after Jenny's no-show, happens to knock on his door, a girl who is not only still a schoolgirl but is also his headmaster's daughter.
Take a Girl Like You	18	22	It would now appear that Patrick and Jenny have broken up but at a boozy and somewhat riotous party at Julian's house, Patrick takes advantage, in the early hours, of a tired and sozzled Jenny in one of the guest bedrooms.

Smart People	1	28	The professor is bitter, arrogant, self-absorbed and uninterested in his students; this does not help him when he parks illegally on campus, his car is impounded and does not pay his fine before getting to the college impound lot watched by a flunked former student.

Smart People	15	28	After Chuck gets Vanessa drunk to celebrate her early acceptance into Stanford University, she makes a pass at him, which he rejects.

Smart People	23	28	Finding him preoccupied by his book's publishing and an ongoing campaign to become chairman of the English Department, Janet is again upset by Lawrence's self-absorption and breaks up with him without telling him the news.

Eagle vs Shark	22	64	Jarrod's sister (Nancy) and brother-in-law (Doug) seem to sell all kinds of "sell from home products", like questionable make-up kits, knives and their own athletic jumpsuit clothing line "Awesome apparel".
Eagle vs Shark	23	64	Jarrod's dad, Jonah, is a withdrawn man in a wheelchair.
Eagle vs Shark	24	64	Jarrod spends his time alternating between trying to win his dad's affection and training for his impending fight with his high school bully Eric Elisi.
Eagle vs Shark	25	64	It becomes clear his father loved his other son Gordon much more than Jarrod.
Eagle vs Shark	26	64	Gordon was very successful, winning many ribbons, especially in running.
Eagle vs Shark	27	64	When Lily asks how Gordon died, Jarrod says that he died saving a kid from a fire at the school.
Eagle vs Shark	28	64	Lily meets with Mason—Jarrod's best friend and computer geek—to find out that Eric will return from Samoa the next day.
Eagle vs Shark	29	64	The three then creep up to Eric's house to drop off Jarrod's invitation to the fight between the two of them.
Eagle vs Shark	30	64	Gordon's fiancee, Tracy, comes over.
Eagle vs Shark	31	64	She seems to be a person of similar success to Gordon and Jarrod's father even loves her more than Jarrod.
Eagle vs Shark	32	64	Jarrod tries to impress his father with the news he's dating Lily, but father isn't impressed.
Eagle vs Shark	33	64	The two go to the beach and Lily finds a rock shaped like a heart that she shows Jarrod.
Eagle vs Shark	34	64	He tells her that he must break up with her, as he's too busy with the revenge mission and "too complex" for a relationship.
Eagle vs Shark	35	64	Lily is visibly upset but tries to hide it.
Eagle vs Shark	36	64	Jarrod takes flowers over to Tracy's house and spends the day with her on the beach trying to impress her with his "fighting skills".
Eagle vs Shark	37	64	She isn't impressed.
Eagle vs Shark	38	64	Meanwhile, it's been revealed that Jarrod has a little girl from a random sexual encounter at a party, who is nine whom he sees only occasionally.
Eagle vs Shark	39	64	Lily and the girl walk with Jonah around town coming to a hill.
Eagle vs Shark	40	64	He refuses to go any farther, holding the wheels of his wheelchair and finally getting up out of his wheelchair and walking himself and his wheelchair home, exposing that he doesn't need it.
Eagle vs Shark	41	64	Lily and the girl continue up the hill where the girl says that "That's where my Uncle Gordon died", revealing that Gordon did not die saving a child from a fire as Jarrod had said, but by committing suicide.
Eagle vs Shark	42	64	They return home and the family eats dinner.
Eagle vs Shark	43	64	Lily tells a silly joke and the whole group gets along very well.
Eagle vs Shark	44	64	Jarrod comes home to find the group laughing and then kills the mood by saying that he'd been with Tracy all day and that they'd been laughing harder.
Eagle vs Shark	45	64	Jarrod's father Jonah spends most of his time watching an old tape of Gordon winning a cross country meet and reliving the victory that he felt at that time.
Eagle vs Shark	46	64	In the video, Gordon wins the race and is congratulated obsessively by his father.
Eagle vs Shark	47	64	Tracy comes over and the two are celebrating.
Eagle vs Shark	48	64	Jarrod then attempts to come over and is pushed away by the father.
Eagle vs Shark	49	64	Seeing his father watching this and feeling even more alienated, Jarrod falsely announces that he is dating Tracy.
Eagle vs Shark	50	64	Jonah is crushed.
Eagle vs Shark	51	64	Lily, annoyed by this, leaves the house and takes her sleeping bag from the tent, choosing to sleep over on the other side of the yard instead, stubbornly refusing Jarrod's offer to use it.
Eagle vs Shark	52	64	He moves the tent to her and sleeps inside it, although it collapses on top of him.
Eagle vs Shark	53	64	Annoyed by Jarrod's behavior, Lily decides to go with Doug and Nancy to a local party.
Eagle vs Shark	54	64	She gets very drunk and dances with a lot of boys while Jarrod jealously looks on.
Eagle vs Shark	55	64	Eventually, she runs off, ripping off all her clothes and sleeping in the bushes somewhere.
Eagle vs Shark	56	64	In the morning, she returns, and Jarrod tells her he didn't get any sleep that night worrying about her.
Eagle vs Shark	57	64	That afternoon, Jarrod, with his family and friends watching, confronts Eric and finds out that Eric is paralyzed and uses a wheelchair.
Eagle vs Shark	58	64	Eric apologizes for how he bullied him in high school, but Jarrod attacks him anyway with a set of nunchucks.
Eagle vs Shark	59	64	Despite his condition, Eric is able to easily wrestle Jarrod to the ground and only relents in his attacks when Jarrod's father tells him to leave him alone.
Eagle vs Shark	60	64	Jarrod is depressed about his fight with Eric but Lily finds him and attempts to cheer him up.
Eagle vs Shark	61	64	Lily tells him she is leaving for home on the following day—but that could change.
Eagle vs Shark	62	64	At the bus stop, Jarrod is waiting for her, presenting her with a bouquet of lilies.
Eagle vs Shark	63	64	They reconcile and journey back on a bus together.

Casual Sex?	10	59	She lets Nick move in with her to try to get his fledgling music career off the ground.

Casual Sex?	25	59	How do you do it.
Casual Sex?	26	59	" Stacy shares that she is in "relationship hell" at the moment, which surprises Vinny (as he is and has been enamored of Stacy thus far, viewing her as a very desirable woman and an all-around winner).
Casual Sex?	27	59	When she asks him what he looks for in a woman, she is touched by what he shares with her and gets a new, enlightened view of him (ie, that there is more to Vinny than the desperate, pathetic, trying-too-hard act she saw in him at the resort).

Casual Sex?	29	59	He keeps in touch with Stacy via handwritten letters, sharing with her the epiphanies he is experiencing and how he is becoming a different person and his life is advancing and improving.
Casual Sex?	30	59	Meanwhile, back in her home, Stacy has confronted Nick and told him their relationship won't work.
Casual Sex?	31	59	Nick is taken aback, acts hurt, and defiantly says that he sees himself as on the way to making it big in the music business and way beyond even what she can ever envision and that she will regret her decision.
Casual Sex?	32	59	She wishes him the best and he storms out with his belongings.
Casual Sex?	33	59	At this point, Stacy is relieved that it has ended and she is determined to take a break from men-at-large for an unspecified span of time to sort things out in her head.
Casual Sex?	34	59	Some time later, Stacy visits Melissa and Jamie, who now live together in their own home.
Casual Sex?	35	59	At the end of the evening, Stacy says goodbye to Melissa and Jamie.

Casual Sex?	38	59	He shares with Stacy that he started driving from his home in New Jersey just to take a drive and, the next thing he knew, he found himself in Chicago, Illinois.
Casual Sex?	39	59	He then asked himself, "Vinny, where are you going.
Casual Sex?	40	59	" He says he realized that he was driving to see Stacy.
Casual Sex?	41	59	He wound up driving all the way from New Jersey to southern California just to see her.
Casual Sex?	42	59	Stacy is taken with this and yet, when he asks her if she'd like to talk or go someplace together, she initially is hesitant and says to him that it was very late.
Casual Sex?	43	59	Vinny, being a gentleman this time (in contrast with their past times together) acts with reserve and respectfully takes her cue.
Casual Sex?	44	59	Stacy apparently is moved by this and, seeing how he drove all the way from New Jersey to California just to see her, she calls out to him and says that, if he likes, he can come home with her and she can make him breakfast.
Casual Sex?	45	59	He pauses a bit, turns around, and says that he is rather hungry, accepts her invitation, and even offers to be the one who makes breakfast.
Casual Sex?	46	59	He says he has a gift for her.

Casual Sex?	55	59	Melissa replies, "So what, there's yours".
Casual Sex?	56	59	Finally, Stacy says to the camera, "Yeah, that's my boyfriend".

Ten Inch Hero	22	46	Tish asserts that he and Brad are gay, but will not admit it to themselves so they use the pretense of a threesome to have sex with each other.

Ten Inch Hero	33	46	He finally works up the courage to ask her out, to which she happily agrees.
Ten Inch Hero	34	46	She has had a crush on him since high school, when she was a shy freshman, and even though it is decades later, she says that many still carry high school within themselves, so she could never show Trucker how she felt despite now being a confident and secure woman.

Ten Inch Hero	36	46	She happily agrees.
Ten Inch Hero	37	46	At the shop, a homeless man comes in and tells Jen that he thinks she's really pretty, and that she's exactly who he had hoped she'd be.

Ten Inch Hero	42	46	He had been hinting throughout the movie that he was interested in her, but was frustrated because she seemed to never notice him and she was wasting her time with shallow relationships with guys she could manipulate, rather than seeking emotional intimacy.
Ten Inch Hero	43	46	She agrees to go out on a date with him but only on the condition that he tell her his first name, which turns out to be Boaz.
Ten Inch Hero	44	46	She then reveals that her first name is actually Platisha.

The House Bunny	0	25	Shelley Darlington (Anna Faris) is an aspiring Playboy Playmate living the life of luxury in the Playboy Mansion.
The House Bunny	1	25	The day after her twenty-seventh birthday, she awakes to find a note, seemingly from Hugh Hefner, asking her to pack up and leave.
The House Bunny	2	25	She happens to stumble upon a group of girls who remind her of herself: beautiful and fun.
The House Bunny	3	25	She follows them and sees that they live in luxury too.
The House Bunny	4	25	They turn out to be the Phi Iota Mu sorority, and snobbishly reject her when she tries to join them.
The House Bunny	5	25	She makes her way down to the Zeta Alpha Zeta house, which appears to be far less luxurious than the first sorority she visited.
The House Bunny	6	25	The members of the Zeta house are dowdy, socially awkward, and caught off guard by Shelley's bubbly nature, prompting them to initially reject her.
The House Bunny	7	25	Once they see Shelley's ability to attract boys, the Zetas change their mind and take in Shelley as their new "house mother", hoping that she can save them: their sorority is in danger of being shut down unless they can get thirty new pledges to join.
The House Bunny	8	25	During her time spent with the Zetas, Shelley meets and becomes attracted to an intellectual, altruistic guy named Oliver (Colin Hanks), who works at a retirement home.
The House Bunny	9	25	Shelley goes out on a date with Oliver, and while her flirty tactics work with most guys, they fail with him, for he is a guy who actually wants to get to know Shelley rather than just sleep with her.
The House Bunny	10	25	To impress Oliver on their upcoming second date, Shelley starts attending classes and reading books, and tones down her appearance.
The House Bunny	11	25	The second date is also a disaster because she wears glasses that aren't meant for her, and brings along note cards to help her sound smart.
The House Bunny	12	25	Having gotten a makeover and lessons on how to attract guys and be popular, the Zetas throw a party, which is a huge success.
The House Bunny	13	25	Later, the Zetas are reviewing the girls who are hoping to pledge to Zeta, but their new popularity has made them conceited.
The House Bunny	14	25	When they realize what they've become, they blame Shelley—just as she returns from her unsuccessful date.
The House Bunny	15	25	Although Shelley had just been invited back to the Playboy mansion (after Hefner had learned of the forged dismissal) and decided to stay with the Zetas, the unexpected attack from them makes her reconsider, and she calls back to accept the invitation.
The House Bunny	16	25	The Zetas then feel guilty, and decide to give themselves a second makeover, this time being "Half-Shelley and Half-Themselves".
The House Bunny	17	25	They also decide to draw the pledges out at random, instead of judging them.
The House Bunny	18	25	They show up at Shelley's photo shoot and ask for her to come back, to which she agrees, having changed her mind about her dream of being a centerfold.
The House Bunny	19	25	The rival Phi Iota Mu sorority intercepts the invitations and prevents them from being mailed out, so the Zetas are again in danger of being shut down at the campus meeting of the Panhellenic Council.
The House Bunny	20	25	Shelley crashes the meeting and gives a heartfelt speech about what her experience with the Zetas has taught her about love and acceptance, and asks for pledges on the spot; gradually thirty students agree to pledge, and the sorority is saved.
The House Bunny	21	25	Oliver and Shelley reconcile, and Shelley explains that she likes Oliver a lot and was trying too hard to impress him.
The House Bunny	22	25	They decide to start over with their relationship and Oliver is looking forward to getting to know the "real" Shelley.
The House Bunny	23	25	The film ends with Zetas and their new pledges celebrating.
The House Bunny	24	25	Shelley has remained in close contact with mr Hefner and her friends at the Playboy mansion.

The Model and the Marriage Broker	16	24	When Kitty goes to make up with Mae at her office, she runs into mr Johannson, one of Mae's clients, who needs help desperately to patch up his relationship.
The Model and the Marriage Broker	17	24	Kitty reluctantly takes the absent Mae's place.
The Model and the Marriage Broker	18	24	Then Mae's friend Doberman explains how badly she hurt Mae, that Mae thought of her as the daughter she never had, and that Mae helps those who are shy, need a helpful push, or are not as pretty as Kitty.
The Model and the Marriage Broker	19	24	Afterward, Kitty tries to arrange a relationship for Mae with Dan Chancellor, a wealthy Canadian bachelor who had heard of Mae's service.
The Model and the Marriage Broker	20	24	Mae and Kitty become friends again, but Mae comes to realize she herself will never be lonely as long as she has people to help.
The Model and the Marriage Broker	21	24	She decides that Dan would actually be a better match for Emmy.
The Model and the Marriage Broker	22	24	In addition, Matt realizes he wants to marry Kitty after all, and gets her to agree to it.

The Fighting Temptations	0	41	In the year 1980, a young boy named Darrin Hill (Cuba Gooding Jr) and his mother, MaryAnn (Faith Evans), are run out of their hometown of Monte Carlo, Georgia, after MaryAnn is soon discovered to be singing secular music when she sings in a church choir also.
The Fighting Temptations	1	41	Aunt Sally Walker (Ann Nesby), Darrin's great-aunt, attempts to defend MaryAnn but fails, and the church's pastor, Reverend Paul Lewis (Wendell Pierce), is too afraid of the other church members to let her stay.
The Fighting Temptations	2	41	MaryAnn and Darrin are last seen on a bus saying goodbye to Aunt Sally, as they sadly wave to each other.
The Fighting Temptations	3	41	In 2003, Darrin has grown up to become a successful advertising executive in New York City with a bad habit of lying.
The Fighting Temptations	4	41	His only true friend and secretary, Rosa Lopez (Lourdes Benedicto), does a good job at keeping his credit problems under control.

The Fighting Temptations	7	41	After being tracked down by a private investigator, Darrin soon finds out that Aunt Sally has died.
The Fighting Temptations	8	41	Darrin returns to his hometown of Monte Carlo, Georgia, and on the way, looks back on both comical and heartwarming memories of MaryAnn (who is later revealed to have died in a car accident when Darrin was a teenager) and the experiences they had together.

The Fighting Temptations	12	41	Upon taking charge of the once-powerful choir, Darrin discovers that it has fallen into decline over the years, with only a handful of members remaining.
The Fighting Temptations	13	41	He also faces opposition from Reverend Lewis's sister, Paulina Prickett (LaTanya Richardson), the church's high-strung and wicked treasurer, and the same woman who led the townspeople into driving Darrin and his mother out of Monte Carlo years before.
The Fighting Temptations	14	41	Paulina holds a grudge against Darrin because of his mother and for "stealing" her spot as choir director, as she was next in line and had waited for years for Sally to pass away.
The Fighting Temptations	15	41	After several setbacks, Darrin eventually recruits many new members, most of which he does so by promising half of the competition's prize money to them (though he has no intention of paying anyone).
The Fighting Temptations	16	41	He also reconnects into his old childhood friend and crush Lilly (Beyoncé Knowles), who has faced ostracization from the townspeople similar to MaryAnn's, due to her being an R&B nightclub singer, and having a son, Dean, out of wedlock.
The Fighting Temptations	17	41	Lilly initially refuses to join the choir as she is both put off by Darrin's romantic advances and because she doesn't want to put up with the townpeople's criticism of her, but with some assurance from Darrin, she ultimately relents and becomes the new lead singer of the choir, causing Paulina to quit in retaliation.
The Fighting Temptations	18	41	Several weeks later, Paulina reveals that Darrin forgot to enter the choir into the auditions on time.

The Fighting Temptations	27	41	Lilly, furious and heartbroken about this, tells Darrin that she doesn't care what he does; she was only using him because he was using her, and the people whom he promised money to begin to panic.
The Fighting Temptations	28	41	Since Lilly wants nothing to do with him, Darrin decides to quit and returns to New York, where he has been offered his job back.
The Fighting Temptations	29	41	However, when Darrin goes back and gets a new condo and a promotion, he comes to realize that none of these things mean anything without Lilly and the choir.
The Fighting Temptations	30	41	Darrin quits his job and returns to Monte Carlo to reconcile with Lilly.
The Fighting Temptations	31	41	The two then recruit Lucious and the Reverend and all of them rush down to the Gospel Explosion to join the choir for the performance.
The Fighting Temptations	32	41	When Darrin and Lilly arrive, Paulina tries to keep them out, citing that Darrin forfeited his inheritance when he left Monte Carlo.
The Fighting Temptations	33	41	However, Reverend Lewis finally stands up to Paulina and calls her out for being a selfish, conniving, hypocritical individual.
The Fighting Temptations	34	41	He then reveals to the choir that her husband, whom she previously had claimed was deceased, is alive and remarried to a better woman.
The Fighting Temptations	35	41	Lilly scolds Paulina for insulting Sally's will and wishes, which gave Darrin the choir.
The Fighting Temptations	36	41	They manage to convince the others to vote Paulina out of the choir, giving Darrin his position as director back.

Un couple épatant	53	72	She tells him that he must do something, but by then his paranoia has kicked in and he has begun adding up facts into a big scheme to kill him, which also involves his children, based on the song that they sang to him at his birthday and the changes that they made to fit him (the song involves the story of a poor boy who has to steal flowers for his dying mother in the hospital, only to find that when he finally arrives, she is already dead), Alain changes his will again: all goes to Claire.
Un couple épatant	54	72	As they talk, enters Vincent, Claire's boyfriend and an employee of Alain's who is back home due to a working accident, but Alain does not believe him since the prescription is signed by dr Georges Colinet, thus Vincent is in the plot too.

Warm Bodies	0	85	In a post-apocalyptic future, a male zombie still in the early stages of decay lives in a community of the Dead in an abandoned airport near the city.
Warm Bodies	1	85	He refers to himself as “R” since he cannot remember his full name, among other details of his life.
Warm Bodies	2	85	R reveals through first person narrative that human civilization has been destroyed by wars and disasters, resulting in a mysterious zombie plague.
Warm Bodies	3	85	Now whole communities of zombies live in hives, and are separated into two categories based on the amount of decay: Fleshies, the Dead who still have flesh on them, and Boneys, the Dead who have been reduced to nothing more than skeletons with bits of muscle keeping them together.
Warm Bodies	4	85	The Boneys are basically the leaders of the Dead, and are seemingly stronger and more intelligent than Fleshies.
Warm Bodies	5	85	They can only be killed if their brains are destroyed.
Warm Bodies	6	85	The zombies are very lethargic for the most part, have limited speech and short memories, and are notably illiterate.
Warm Bodies	7	85	They live in what is a mere, twisted shadow of a normal society.
Warm Bodies	8	85	One of the few times they are truly focused and animated is when they go hunting for the Living, their only food source, during which they spontaneously form a hunting party.
Warm Bodies	9	85	The brain is the best part, because if they eat it, then they can relive the memories, feelings, and thoughts of their prey.
Warm Bodies	10	85	Anything that’s left of the prey is brought back for the others to eat.
Warm Bodies	11	85	R is portrayed as unusual, since he not only contains more empathy and intuition than his fellow Dead, but is also able to express it better than most of them despite being Dead.
Warm Bodies	12	85	He openly shows distaste for eating human flesh, and is the only zombie there who is able to form four, coherent syllables in one breath.
Warm Bodies	13	85	After a hunt, he meets a zombie woman, and they quickly become girlfriend and boyfriend.
Warm Bodies	14	85	She takes him to church where a Bony preacher sees them, and marries them on impulse.
Warm Bodies	15	85	The next day, R and his new wife are presented with two Dead children.
Warm Bodies	16	85	Seeing them try to play like Living children depresses R, and he is gripped with a feeding frenzy.
Warm Bodies	17	85	He leads a hunting party to the city where they find a group of young adults scavenging supplies.
Warm Bodies	18	85	Attacking with unusual energy, R feeds on the brain of a young man named Perry.
Warm Bodies	19	85	After experiencing his memories, R sees Perry’s girlfriend Julie, and in a moment of mercy, saves her from the others.
Warm Bodies	20	85	He disguises her scent with zombie blood, and takes her home where he hides her in a 747 airplane.
Warm Bodies	21	85	The airplane is R’s “house” where he can have some privacy, and hoard the interesting objects he finds.
Warm Bodies	22	85	He slowly gains Julie’s trust, and convinces her to stay for a while until the others forget about her (though in reality, he just really likes her).
Warm Bodies	23	85	Throughout the week, R feeds her food from the airport’s restaurant, entertains her with his treasures, including a record player, and Julie tries to teach him to drive a car which R has managed to get started.
Warm Bodies	24	85	She also tells him a little bit about her life.
Warm Bodies	25	85	In time, R begins feeling guilty over killing Perry, which is made worse since Julie doesn’t know it was him, and is giving him the benefit of the doubt.
Warm Bodies	26	85	Despite his guilt, R continues eating the remains of Perry’s brain, seeing it as a rare treasure.
Warm Bodies	27	85	One night, R eats the last of the brain, and experiences the last of Perry’s memories.
Warm Bodies	28	85	When he begins to witness Perry’s death however, R’s thoughts interrupt the scene in an attempt to halt it.
Warm Bodies	29	85	To his shock, memory pauses, and Perry scolds him, telling him to let Perry have this memory.
Warm Bodies	30	85	R complies, and the memory plays through.
Warm Bodies	31	85	After it ends, R falls asleep.
Warm Bodies	32	85	When he awakens, Julie is being attacked by several zombies, including M, and R helps her fend them off.
Warm Bodies	33	85	M is confused and angry by R’s behavior, but R holds his ground.
Warm Bodies	34	85	Suddenly, some Boneys arrive.
Warm Bodies	35	85	Although they do not attack, one of them shows R some old photos of Dead and Living fighting each other, telling him that they need to maintain the status quo.
Warm Bodies	36	85	They leave along with the rest, and R takes Julie back to the airplane.
Warm Bodies	37	85	In the morning, Julie convinces R to take her home, and they attempt to leave while the Dead watch them, half-fascinated and half-afraid.
Warm Bodies	38	85	However, the Boneys attack and try to kill Julie, but with M’s help, they get away in R’s car.
Warm Bodies	39	85	On the way to the city, it starts raining, and they are forced to stop in the suburbs.
Warm Bodies	40	85	They camp out in one of the houses, and Julie allows R to share a bed with her.
Warm Bodies	41	85	To his surprise, R experiences some more of Perry’s memories, during which R has another conversation with “Perry”.
Warm Bodies	42	85	The next morning, Julie calls her father, and sends R out for fuel.
Warm Bodies	43	85	When he returns however, Julie is gone.
Warm Bodies	44	85	R begins walking back to the airport in a heavy rainstorm, and feels cold for the first time since he “died”.
Warm Bodies	45	85	On the road, R runs into M and some other zombies who have been chased out by the Boneys.
Warm Bodies	46	85	The zombies have been changing like R, and experiencing things such as dreams and old memories.
Warm Bodies	47	85	R decides to go after Julie, and recruits the other zombies’ help to get inside the stadium.
Warm Bodies	48	85	Along the way, Perry shows R more of his memories, saying that he doesn’t want to leave yet.
Warm Bodies	49	85	When R and the others arrive at the stadium, he impersonates a Living person, and has his friends “chase” him to its doors.
Warm Bodies	50	85	The soldiers let him in, and R sneaks through the stadium following Julie’s scent to her house.
Warm Bodies	51	85	R sees Julie on her balcony, and they reunite.
Warm Bodies	52	85	R also meets Nora, Julie’s best friend.
Warm Bodies	53	85	With no other options, the girls let him stay the night, and R has another Perry dream.
Warm Bodies	54	85	The next morning, the girls give R a major make-over to make him look human, and take him on a tour of the city.
Warm Bodies	55	85	They take him to the cemetery where they visit the grave of Julie’s mother, and Julie tells him how her mother died.
Warm Bodies	56	85	While there, R finds Perry’s grave, and has a waking vision of Perry.
Warm Bodies	57	85	By now, it’s become apparent that some form of Perry’s soul is living inside R, and has intertwined with R’s own.
Warm Bodies	58	85	Perry warns him of the changes to come, saying R needs to take control or be swept away.
Warm Bodies	59	85	The vision ends, and the three of them leave the cemetery.
Warm Bodies	60	85	After a tense run-in with Julie’s father, Grigio, they take him to a pub where Julie spikes their drinks with real alcohol, and R gets drunk.
Warm Bodies	61	85	He goes for a walk to clear his head, but runs into a soldier who realizes what he is, forcing R to attack him.
Warm Bodies	62	85	As R begins eating him, he regains control and stops, causing the soldier to reanimate as a zombie.
Warm Bodies	63	85	R runs back to Julie, and finally tells her that he killed Perry.
Warm Bodies	64	85	The Dead soldier is found and killed, but Grigio orders a widespread search to find the second zombie.
Warm Bodies	65	85	He arrives at the house, deduces what R really is, and attacks him despite Julie’s protests.
Warm Bodies	66	85	Nora holds a gun to Grigio, and Julie and R escape from the stadium.
Warm Bodies	67	85	Outside, the crowd of zombies has grown.
Warm Bodies	68	85	What Julie and R have between them has infected many others, causing them to change.
Warm Bodies	69	85	As they deliberate on what to do next, the Boneys attack.
Warm Bodies	70	85	R and Julie flee back to the stadium in the hopes that the Living will kill them off, but the Boneys quickly gather in huge numbers, more than any have ever seen.
Warm Bodies	71	85	Julie is astounded by the siege, but Perry speaks to both of them inside their heads, and tells them that it’s because the Boneys are afraid of the change they represent.
Warm Bodies	72	85	The couple meets up with Nora, and they flee to a roof where they see the battle between the Boneys and the Living.
Warm Bodies	73	85	As they watch, Julie has an epiphany: the plague started because the human race crushed itself beneath the weight of its sins until it released a dark force that changed the humans so that everyone could see their evil.
Warm Bodies	74	85	In the midst of the chaos and bloodshed, R and Julie do the only thing they can think of: they kiss.
Warm Bodies	75	85	The strength of their love cures R of the plague completely and their eyes turn gold.
Warm Bodies	76	85	Suddenly, the moment is interrupted by Grigio, who is quickly descending into madness.
Warm Bodies	77	85	Grigio tries to kill them, but one of his soldiers intervenes, and Grigio nearly falls off the roof.
Warm Bodies	78	85	A Boney appears, and begins eating Grigio, who has finally given up.
Warm Bodies	79	85	Julie shoots it, and both fall off the roof as Grigio shrivels away into a pile of dust and bones.
Warm Bodies	80	85	The fight on the roof somehow causes the Boneys to give up, and they disperse.
Warm Bodies	81	85	After the battle, the Living decide to give the reviving Dead a chance, and let them try to assimilate into their society.
Warm Bodies	82	85	Those that haven’t started changing yet, either start to change or fade away into dust.
Warm Bodies	83	85	In light of the new beginnings, R has decided to remain “R”.
Warm Bodies	84	85	They still have a long way to go, but it’s a start.

Magic in the Moonlight	1	39	As he walks off stage the film audience sees that he is actually a British man named Stanley (Colin Firth).
Magic in the Moonlight	2	39	He berates his employees and is generally curmudgeonly towards his well-wishers.
Magic in the Moonlight	3	39	In his dressing-room, he is greeted by old friend and fellow illusionist Howard Burkan (Simon McBurney).
Magic in the Moonlight	4	39	Howard enlists Stanley to go with him to the Côte d'Azur where a rich American family, the Catledges, has apparently been taken in by a clairvoyant and mystic, Sophie (Emma Stone).
Magic in the Moonlight	5	39	In fact, the son of the family, Brice (Hamish Linklater), is smitten with Sophie, and his sister Caroline (Erica Leerhsen) and brother-in-law George (Jeremy Shamos) are concerned Brice is considering proposing marriage.
Magic in the Moonlight	6	39	Howard says that he has been unable to uncover the secrets behind her tricks and he admits that the more he watched her the more he believed she really has supernatural powers.
Magic in the Moonlight	7	39	So he would like Stanley, who has debunked charlatan mystics in the past, to help him prove she is a fraud.
Magic in the Moonlight	8	39	Howard and Stanley travel to the French Riviera, but Stanley is soon astonished by Sophie's ability to go into a fugue state and apparently pull out highly personal details about him and his family.
Magic in the Moonlight	9	39	Stanley witnesses a seance in which Sophie communicates with the deceased patriarch of the American family.
Magic in the Moonlight	10	39	A candle floats up from the table and Howard grabs it to try to discern what trickery is at play, but is astounded to find no apparent subterfuge.
Magic in the Moonlight	11	39	Stanley begins spending time with Sophie.
Magic in the Moonlight	12	39	He takes her to visit his aunt and they drive a convertible along the picturesque rocky corniches.
Magic in the Moonlight	13	39	When Stanley and Sophie visit his aunt Vanessa (Eileen Atkins), Sophie is seemingly able, after holding aunt Vanessa's pearls, to somehow relate secret details of Vanessa's one great love affair.
Magic in the Moonlight	14	39	This finally convinces Stanley of Sophie's authenticity and he has an emotional epiphany, feeling that his lifelong rationalism and cynicism have been misguided.
Magic in the Moonlight	15	39	When caught in a rain storm, they end up at an observatory that Stanley had visited as a child.
Magic in the Moonlight	16	39	After the rain subsides, they open the roof up and view the stars.
Magic in the Moonlight	17	39	At a Gatsby-esque party, Stanley and Sophie dance.
Magic in the Moonlight	18	39	As they walk together later that night, Sophie asks him if he has felt any feelings for her "as a woman".
Magic in the Moonlight	19	39	Stanley, who has admired her talents as a mystic and is grateful to her for opening his eyes to a new worldview, is taken aback and admits that he has not thought of her that way.
Magic in the Moonlight	20	39	She leaves upset.
Magic in the Moonlight	21	39	The next day Stanley holds a press conference to tell the world that he, who spent his life debunking charlatan mystics, has finally come to find one who is the real deal.
Magic in the Moonlight	22	39	The reporters drill him with questions, but the grilling is interrupted when he receives news his aunt Vanessa has been in a car accident.
Magic in the Moonlight	23	39	Stanley rushes to the hospital, and in an emotional scene in a waiting room considers turning to prayer for solace.
Magic in the Moonlight	24	39	That is, if he now has come to believe in divination and mysticism, perhaps he should believe in God and prayer.
Magic in the Moonlight	25	39	He begins to pray for a miracle to save his aunt, but is unable to go through with it.
Magic in the Moonlight	26	39	The rationality that has been his whole life comes back and he rejects prayer, the supernatural and by extension, Sophie and her powers.
Magic in the Moonlight	27	39	He decides once more to prove she is a fraud.
Magic in the Moonlight	28	39	Using a trick seen earlier in his stage act, Stanley appears to leave the room but stays to overhear Sophie and Howard discuss their collusion in what has been an elaborate ruse.
Magic in the Moonlight	29	39	He discovers that Sophie was able to know so much about him and his aunt because she and Howard collaborated to fool Stanley.
Magic in the Moonlight	30	39	Sophie was indeed a charlatan tricking the rich American family and was quickly discovered by Howard.
Magic in the Moonlight	31	39	Rather than unmask her and stop the ruse, he enlisted Sophie to help him one-up his best friend and rival, Stanley.
Magic in the Moonlight	32	39	Stanley is initially angry at Howard and Sophie but decides to forgive them.
Magic in the Moonlight	33	39	In a conversation with his aunt Vanessa, who by then has recovered from her car accident, Stanley comes to the self-realization that he is in love with Sophie.
Magic in the Moonlight	34	39	He finds her and asks her not to marry Brice, but marry him instead.
Magic in the Moonlight	35	39	Sophie is taken aback and finds his haughty, awkward proposal unsuitable.
Magic in the Moonlight	36	39	She tells him she still plans to marry the wealthy Brice.
Magic in the Moonlight	37	39	Returning dejected to his aunt Vanessa's, Stanley is surprised when Sophie follows him there and he proposes.

Professional Sweetheart	11	29	Ipswich, Speed and Herbert want her to choose someone else, but when "sob sister" reporter Elmerada de Leon (ZaSu Pitts) comes to interview Glory, she spots the photo, so they have to play along.
